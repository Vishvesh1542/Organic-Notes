# Formation of Alkanes
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

$\ce{CH_{2}=CH_{2} + H_{2} ->[Pt / Pd / Ni] H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$ ^fromalkenestoalkanes

- Here, $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ is a very strong reagent, which makes
  $\ce{C=C}$ and even $\ce{C#C}$ into $\ce{C-C}$
- This Reaction is known as 'Hydrogenation'.
- For $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Pd}$ reaction can occur at room temp. But for $\ce{Ni}$ we need high temp.

## Wurtz Reaction

$\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry ether] 2NaCl + CH_{3}-CH_{3}}$ ^wurtzreaction
- It goes through radical Pathway

## From Alkyl Halides 

$\ce{R-X + H_{2} ->[Zn][H+]R-H}$ ^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes

- **Except Fluorine** 
- An example $\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + H_{2}->[Zn][HCl]CH_{4}}$
- The $H^+$ needs to come from some acid.
- Reactivity rate depends upon leaving group ability of $\ce{X-}$
  - in halogens -> $\ce{F_{2} < Cl_{2} < Br_{2} < I_{2}}$

## From Carboxylic Acids

For this we have 2 types of reactions via different methods
### Kolbe's Electrolysis ( Electrical Method )

$\ce{2RCOONa + 2H_{2}O ->[Kolbe's][Electrolysis] R-R + 2CO_{2} + 2NaOH + H_{2}}$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte)
- pH of beaker increases as reaction proceeds
- Reaction proceeds via Radical Pathway 
- The reaction is called Decarboxylation
#### Mechanism

![[Kolbe's Electrolysis Mechanism]]
#### Notes about Kolbe's Electrolysis

- It is electrical method of decarboxylation
- It is good method for preparing alkanes with even no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms
- It is a BAD method for preparation of alkanes with odd no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms as when they are found they are not pure
- **$\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared**
### Soda-Lime Decarboxylation ( Chemical Method )

$\ce{RCOONa + NaOH ->[CaO] Na_{2}CO_{3} + RH }$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes2

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte )
- Its called Soda Lime method as reagents are Caustic Soda ($\ce{NaOH}$) and Quick Lime ($\ce{CaO}$) in the **mole ratio 3:1** 
- Reactivity depends on stability of $\ce{C-}$ intermediate
  - From the Salt remove $\ce{COONa}$ keep $\ce{C-}$ in its place and check its stability
- $\ce{NaOH}$ is VERY important for this reaction as it
  - consumes the $\ce{CO_{2}}$ formed making the slow step faster
  - $\ce{RCOO-}$ wants $\ce{H+}$ from water to form stable $\ce{RCOOH}$ but $\ce{NaOH}$ prevents this and forms $\ce{RCOONa}$ to get pure product

# Chemical Reactions of Alkanes

- Alkane shows **Addition reaction**

## Free Radical Halogenation Disproportionation ( Substitution ) Reaction

$\ce{R-H + Cl_{2} ->[h\nu][or Sunlight] R-Cl + HCl}$^halogenationsubstitutionofalkanes

- Reactivity order -> $\ce{F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} \gg I_{2}}$

#### Mechanism

- Mechanism is divided into 3 steps, Initiation, Propagation and Termination
