# Formation of Alkanes
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

$\ce{CH_{2}=CH_{2} + H_{2} ->[Pt / Pd / Ni]}$%%qf%% $\ce{H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$^fromalkenestoalkanes


- Here, $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ is a very strong reagent, which makes
  $\ce{C=C}$ and even $\ce{C#C}$ into $\ce{C-C}$
- This Reaction is known as **Hydrogenation**.
- For $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Pd}$ reaction can occur at room temp. But for $\ce{Ni}$ we need high temp.

## Wurtz Reaction

$\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry ether]}$%%qf%%$\ce{NaCl + CH_{3}-CH_{3}}$ ^wurtzreaction
<!--SR:!2025-02-15,4,270-->
- It goes through radical Pathway


## From Alkyl Halides 

$\ce{R-X + H_{2} ->[Zn][H+]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-H}$ ^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes
<!--SR:!2025-02-14,3,250-->
- **Except Fluorine** 
- An example $\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + H_{2}->[Zn][HCl]CH_{4}}$
- The $H^+$ needs to come from some acid.
- Reactivity rate depends upon leaving group ability of $\ce{X-}$
  - in halogens -> $\ce{F_{2} < Cl_{2} < Br_{2} < I_{2}}$


## From Carboxylic Acids
For this we have 2 types of reactions via different methods

#### Kolbe's Electrolysis ( Electrical Method )

$\ce{2RCOONa + 2H_{2}O ->[Kolbe's][Electrolysis]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ R-R + 2CO_{2} + 2NaOH + H_{2}}$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte)
- pH of beaker increases as reaction proceeds
- Reaction proceeds via Radical Pathway 
- The reaction is called Decarboxylation
- Read the mechanism [[Kolbe's Electrolysis Mechanism|here]]

###### Notes about Kolbe's Electrolysis
- It is electrical method of decarboxylation,
- It is good method for preparing alkanes with even no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms
- It is a BAD method for preparation of alkanes with odd no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms as when they are found they are not pure
- **$\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared**

### Soda-Lime Decarboxylation ( Chemical Method )

$\ce{RCOONa + NaOH ->[CaO]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + RH }$ ^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes2

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte )
- Its called Soda Lime method as reagents are Caustic Soda ($\ce{NaOH}$) and Quick Lime ($\ce{CaO}$) in the **mole ratio 3:1** 
- Reactivity depends on stability of $\ce{C-}$ intermediate
  - From the Salt remove $\ce{COONa}$ keep $\ce{C-}$ in its place and check its stability
- $\ce{NaOH}$ is VERY important for this reaction as it
  - consumes the $\ce{CO_{2}}$ formed making the slow step faster
  - $\ce{RCOO-}$ wants $\ce{H+}$ from water to form stable $\ce{RCOOH}$ but $\ce{NaOH}$ prevents this and forms $\ce{RCOONa}$ to get pure product
- Read the mechanism [[Soda-Lime Decarboxylation Mechanism|here]]

## From Aldehydes and Ketones
![[Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones]] ^fromaldehydesandketonestoalkanes
- There are two methods in preparing Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones
- First one is called **Clemmenson Reduction** and second one is called **Wolff-Kishner** 

###### Flash card
$\ce{R-C(O)-R ->[Zn(Hg)][con. HCl]}$%%qf%%![[Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones]] Clemmenson Reduction

 $\ce{R-C(O)-R ->[NH_{2}-NH_{2}][Ethylene Glycol, KOH, \Delta]}$%%qf%%![Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones](Alkanes%20from%20Aldehydes%20and%20Ketones.md)Wolf-Kishner Reduction
 
# Chemical Reactions of Alkanes
- Alkane shows **Addition reaction**
- Most of these go through Radical pathway
## Free Radical Halogenation Disproportionation ( Substitution ) Reaction

$\ce{R-H + Cl_{2} ->[h\nu]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-Cl + HCl}$^halogenationsubstitutionofalkanes

$\ce{R-H + X_{2} ->[h\nu]}$ %%qf%%$\ce{R-X + HX}$^freeradicalhalogenationofalkanes

- Reactivity order in free Radical Halogenation %%qf%%-> $\ce{F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} \gg I_{2}}$
- Read the mechanism [[Free Radical Halogenation Mechanism|here]]


##### Deciding Major products in halogenation of Alkanes-

- To decide major products in Halogenation of alkanes we use **Selectivity Ratios**
- Selectivity Ratios only exist for $\ce{Br_{2} and Cl_{2}}$
- Major product is the Carbon replacement that has highest of
$$
\text{No. of H of a given degree} \times \text{Selectivity Number of that degree}
$$
- We can also calculate Yield percentage of products in halogenation of Alkanes using the following formula %%qf%%$$\frac{\text{n(H) of given degree} \times \text{SN of degree}}{\Sigma \; \text{n(H) of  given degree} \times \text{SN of that degree}}\times100$$
<!--SR:!2025-02-15,4,270-->

- Selectivity ratios for $\ce{Cl_{2}}$ are given as
%%sf%%

| **Degree of $\ce{H}$** | 1°  | 2°  | 3°  |
| ---------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Selectivity Number** | 1   | 3.8 | 5   |

%%ef%%

- Selectivity ratios for $\ce{Br_{2}}$ are given as follows
%%sf%%

| **Degree of $\ce{H}$** | 1°  | 2°  | 3°   |
| ---------------------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| **Selectivity Number** | 1   | 82  | 1600 |
%%ef%%

- For $\ce{Br_{2}}$ the difference between the numbers is very large hence as a shortcut we can use stability of radical formed to determine the major product
-  A close relation to Selectivity Ratio calculations is mole fraction

## Isomerisation
$\ce{CH_{3}-(CH_{2})4-CH_{3}->[anhy. AlCl_{3}][HCl]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(CH_{3})-(CH_{2})2-CH_{3}}$ ( Isomerisation ) ^isomerisation
- In Isomerisation, $\ce{anhy. AlCl_{3}}/HCl$ converts **n-Alkanes** only to other isomers by attaching the Methyl group to other places
- Only report the major products as minor products are generally not reported

## Aromatization 
$\ce{CH_{3}-(CH_{2})4-CH_{3} ->[Mo_{2}O_{3} or Cr_{2}O_{3}][or V_{2}O_{5}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{Benzene}$ (aromatization) ^aromatization

- **n-Alkanes** having six or more C atoms on heating to 773K at 10-20 atm in presence of $\ce{Mo_{2}O_{3}}$ or $\ce{V_{2}O_{5}}$ or $\ce{Cr_{2}O_{3}}$ form Benzene or its forms.
- For example, 7 membered ring will form Toluene.

## Reaction with Steam
- Methane reacts with steam at 1273 K in presence of Ni catalyst to form CO and $\ce{H_{2}}$ 
$\ce{CH_{4} +O_{2}->[Ni][\Delta]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CO + H_{2}}$
