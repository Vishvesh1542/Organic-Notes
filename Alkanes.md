# Formation of Alkanes
## From Alkenes/Alkynes
$\ce{CH_{2}=CH_{2} + H_{2} ->[Pt / Pd / Ni]}$ <!----> $\ce{H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$^fromalkenestoalkanes
<!--SR:!2025-02-03,4,270-->


- Here, $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ is a very strong reagent, which makes
  $\ce{C=C}$ and even $\ce{C#C}$ into $\ce{C-C}$
- This Reaction is known as **Hydrogenation**.
- For $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Pd}$ reaction can occur at room temp. But for $\ce{Ni}$ we need high temp.

## Wurtz Reaction
$\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry ether]}$<!----> $\ce{NaCl + CH_{3}-CH_{3}}$ ^wurtzreaction
<!--SR:!2025-02-03,4,270-->
- It goes through radical Pathway


## From Alkyl Halides 
$\ce{R-X + H_{2} ->[Zn][H+]R-H}$ ^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes

- **Except Fluorine** 
- An example $\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + H_{2}->[Zn][HCl]CH_{4}}$
- The $H^+$ needs to come from some acid.
- Reactivity rate depends upon leaving group ability of $\ce{X-}$
  - in halogens -> $\ce{F_{2} < Cl_{2} < Br_{2} < I_{2}}$


## From Carboxylic Acids
For this we have 2 types of reactions via different methods

#### Kolbe's Electrolysis ( Electrical Method )
$\ce{2RCOONa + 2H_{2}O ->[Kolbe's][Electrolysis]}$ <!----> $\ce{ R-R + 2CO_{2} + 2NaOH + H_{2}}$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes
<!--SR:!2025-02-02,3,250-->

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte)
- pH of beaker increases as reaction proceeds
- Reaction proceeds via Radical Pathway 
- The reaction is called Decarboxylation
- Read the mechanism [[Kolbe's Electrolysis Mechanism|here]]
###### Notes about Kolbe's Electrolysis
- It is electrical method of decarboxylation,
- It is good method for preparing alkanes with even no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms
- It is a BAD method for preparation of alkanes with odd no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms as when they are found they are not pure
- **$\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared**

### Soda-Lime Decarboxylation ( Chemical Method )
$\ce{RCOONa + NaOH ->[CaO]}$<!---->$\ce{ Na_{2}CO_{3} + RH }$ ^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes2
<!--SR:!2025-02-04,3,250-->

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte )
- Its called Soda Lime method as reagents are Caustic Soda ($\ce{NaOH}$) and Quick Lime ($\ce{CaO}$) in the **mole ratio 3:1** 
- Reactivity depends on stability of $\ce{C-}$ intermediate
  - From the Salt remove $\ce{COONa}$ keep $\ce{C-}$ in its place and check its stability
- $\ce{NaOH}$ is VERY important for this reaction as it
  - consumes the $\ce{CO_{2}}$ formed making the slow step faster
  - $\ce{RCOO-}$ wants $\ce{H+}$ from water to form stable $\ce{RCOOH}$ but $\ce{NaOH}$ prevents this and forms $\ce{RCOONa}$ to get pure product
- Read the mechanism [[Soda-Lime Decarboxylation Mechanism|here]]

## From Aldehydes and Ketones
![[Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones]] ^fromaldehydesandketonestoalkanes
- There are two methods in preparing Alkanes from Aldehydes and Ketones
- First one is called **Clemmenson Reduction** and second one is called **Wolff-Kishner**

# Chemical Reactions of Alkanes
- Alkane shows **Addition reaction**
## Free Radical Halogenation Disproportionation ( Substitution ) Reaction
$\ce{R-H + Cl_{2} ->[h\nu]}$<!---->$\ce{R-Cl + HCl}$^halogenationsubstitutionofalkanes
<!--SR:!2025-02-02,3,250-->

- Reactivity order in free Radical Halogenation <!----> -> $\ce{F_{2} > Cl_{2} > Br_{2} \gg I_{2}}$

##### Deciding Major products in halogenation of Alkanes-
- To decide major products in Halogenation of alkanes we use **Selectivity Ratios**
- Selectivity Ratios only exist for $\ce{Br_{2} and Cl_{2}}$
- Major product is the Carbon replacement that has highest of
$$
\text{No. of H of a given degree} \times \text{Selectivity Number of that degree}
$$
- We can also calculate Yield percentage of products in halogenation of Alkanes using the following formula <!---->$$\frac{\text{n(H) of given degree} \times \text{SN of degree}}{\Sigma \; \text{n(H) of  given degree} \times \text{SN of that degree}}\times100$$
<!--SR:!2025-02-02,1,210-->
- Selectivity ratios for $\ce{Cl_{2}}$ are given as follows

| **Degree of $\ce{H}$** | 1°  | 2°  | 3°  |
| ---------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Selectivity Number** | 1   | 3.8 | 5   |
- Selectivity ratios for $\ce{Br_{2}}$ are given as follows

| **Degree of $\ce{H}$** | 1°  | 2°  | 3°   |
| ---------------------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| **Selectivity Number** | 1   | 82  | 1600 |
- For $\ce{Br_{2}}$ the difference between the numbers is very large hence as a shortcut we can use stability of radical formed to determine the major product
