# Formation of Alkanes
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

$\ce{CH_{2}=CH_{2} + H_{2} ->[Pt / Pd / Ni] H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$ ^fromalkenestoalkanes

- Here, $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ is a very strong reagent, which makes
  $\ce{C=C}$ and even $\ce{C#C}$ into $\ce{C-C}$
- This Reaction is known as 'Hydrogenation'.
- For $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Pd}$ reaction can occur at room temp. But for $\ce{Ni}$ we need high temp.

## Wurtz Reaction
$\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry ether] 2NaCl + CH_{3}-CH_{3}}$ ^wurtzreaction
- It goes through radical Pathway

## From Alkyl Halides 
$\ce{R-X + H_{2} ->[Zn][H+]R-H}$ ^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes
- **Except Fluorine** 
- An example $\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + H_{2}->[Zn][HCl]CH_{4}}$
- The $H^+$ needs to come from some acid.
