# Formation of Alkanes
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

$\ce{CH_{2}=CH_{2} + H_{2} ->[Pt / Pd / Ni] H_{3}C-CH_{3}}$ ^fromalkenestoalkanes

- Here, $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ is a very strong reagent, which makes
  $\ce{C=C}$ and even $\ce{C#C}$ into $\ce{C-C}$
- This Reaction is known as 'Hydrogenation'.
- For $\ce{Pt}$ and $\ce{Pd}$ reaction can occur at room temp. But for $\ce{Ni}$ we need high temp.

## Wurtz Reaction
$\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry ether] 2NaCl + CH_{3}-CH_{3}}$ ^wurtzreaction
- It goes through radical Pathway

## From Alkyl Halides 

$\ce{R-X + H_{2} ->[Zn][H+]R-H}$ ^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes

- **Except Fluorine** 
- An example $\ce{CH_{3}-Cl + H_{2}->[Zn][HCl]CH_{4}}$
- The $H^+$ needs to come from some acid.

## From Carboxylic Acids

For this we have 2 types of reactions via different methods
### Kolbe's Electrolysis ( Electrical Method )

$\ce{2RCOONa + 2H_{2}O ->[Kolbe's][Electrolysis] R-R + 2CO_{2} + 2NaOH + H_{2}}$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte)
- pH of beaker increases as reaction proceeds
- Reaction proceeds via Radical Pathway 
- The reaction is called Decarboxylation
#### Mechanism

#### Notes about Kolbe's Electrolysis

- It is electrical method of decarboxylation
- It is good method for preparing alkanes with even no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms
- It is a BAD method for preparation of alkanes with odd no. of $\ce{C}$ atoms as when they are found they are not pure
- **$\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared**
### Soda-Lime Decarboxylation ( Chemical Method )

$\ce{RCOONa + NaOH ->[CaO] Na_{2}CO_{3} + RH }$^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes2

- Reason for using Sodium salt of carboxylic acids is that it dissociates completely in water ( Strong Electrolyte )
- Its called Soda Lime method as reagents are Caustic Soda ($\ce{NaOH}$) and Quick Lime ($\ce{CaO}$) in the **mole ratio 3:1**
