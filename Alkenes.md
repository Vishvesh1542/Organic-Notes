# Formation of Alkenes

## From Alkynes

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} / Pd-C]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-CH=CH-R (cis alkene)}$^fromalkynestocisalkenes
- The $\ce{H_{2} /Pd-C}$ reagent is divided into two categories (**Rosenmund and Lindlar**)

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} +Na][liq. NH_{3}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-CH=CH-R (trans alkene)}$^fromalkynestotransalkenes
- This is **Birch Reduction**

In both the reactions the reagents are strong reductants but both are requires for cis or trans alkene

## From Alkyl Halides

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(Br)-CH_{3} ->[Alcoholic KOH][\Delta]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} + HBr}$^fromalkylhalidestoalkenes

- The most acidic $\ce{H}$ and $\ce{Br}$ will be removed

## From Vicinal Di-Halides

$\ce{R(X)-R(X)->[Zn]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ZnX_{2} + R=R}$^fromvicinaldihalidestoalkenes
- $\ce{Zn}$ wants +2 oxidation state which is the reason this reaction happens

## From Alcohols

$\ce{RH-CH_{2}(-OH)->[conc.H_{2}SO_{4}][\Delta]}$ %%qf%%$\ce{R=CH_{2}}$^fromalcoholstoalkenes
- Water was removed hence this reaction is a **Dehydration** Reaction

## Ozonolysis

#### Reductive Ozonolysis ( default )

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[(i) O_{3}][(ii) Zn-H_{2}O]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=O + CH_{2}=O}$ ^ozonolysisofalkenes
- Break the $\ce{=}$ bond and add $\ce{=O}$ to both the $\ce{C}$ atom.

Reagents for Reductive Ozonolysis:
1. $\ce{O_{3}}$
2. $\ce{Zn-H_{2}O}$ or $\ce{Raney Ni}$ or $\ce{Me_{2}S}$

- When you have benzene with other bonds, try to break other bonds first.
- When you have no other bonds, Drastic conditions, and lots of $\ce{O_{3}}$ all three $\pi$ bonds will break in Benzene
- In the above reaction, all $\pi$ bonds broke and attach $\ce{O}$ to all $\ce{C}$

##### Mechanism
- [[Ozonolysis Mechanism]]

#### Oxidative Ozonolysis
$\ce{CH_{3}-CH#CH_{2} ->[O_{3}][H_{2}O]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(O)-C(O)H -> CH_{3}COOH + HCOOH}$ ^ozonolysisofalkynesesoxidative

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[O_{3}][H_{2}O]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(O) + HC(O)H -> CH_{3}COOH + HCOOH}$ ^ozonolysisofalkenesoxidative
- Basically the same but after breaking C-C bond and adding $\ce{=O}$ if you get Aldehyde then convert it to Carboxylic acid and leave ketones as is.
- if **formic acid**( $\ce{HCOOH}$ ) forms according to question oxidize it further to $\ce{HO-C(O)-OH}$ and $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$ if those are the options given 

Reagents for oxidative ozonolysis -
1. $\ce{O_{3}}$
2. $\ce{H_{2}O}$ or $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$ or $\ce{CH_{3}COOOH}$
##### Mechanism
- [[Ozonolysis Mechanism]]
## To Alcohols

- There are many ways to convert Alkenes to Alcohols.
  1. $\ce{H_{2}O / H+}$ ( from Acids )
  2. $\ce{Hg(OAC)2 / H_{2}O / NaBH_{4}}$
  3. $\ce{B_{2}H_{6} , THF / H_{2}O_{2} / OH-}$
  4. $\ce{Cold KMnO_{4} in aq. OH-}$

#### Hydration

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[H_{2}O / H+]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-C(OH)-CH_{3}}$ ^hydrationofalkenes
- This is a $\ce{C+}$ pathway!
##### Mechanism
[Hydration Mechanism](Hydration%20Mechanism.md)

#### Oxymercuration-Demercuration


$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[(i) Hg(OAC)2][(ii) H_{2}O \newline (iii) NaBH_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ CH_{3}-CH(OH)-CH_{3}}$ ^oxymercurationdemercuration
- $\ce{OH}$ always attaches to the $\ce{C}$ which has the lower number of $\ce{H}$ attached
- Also called **Marconikoff product**
##### Mechanism
- [oxymercuration-demercuration Mechanism](oxymercuration-demercuration%20Mechanism.md)

#### Hydroboration-Oxidation

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{3} ->[(i) B_{2}H_{6} / THF][(ii) H_{2}O_{2} / OH-]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-OH}$ ^hydroborationoxidation

- This is **Anti Marconikoff product**. OH attaches to that C atom which has the higher number of H attached to it.


#### Alcoholic Substitution 

$\ce{R=R ->[Cold KMnO_{4}][aq.OH-]}$ %%qf%%$\ce{R(-OH)-R(-OH) }$^fromalkenestodiols

- This reaction is a **syn addition** ( both OH are attached at same side )
## To Alkyl Halides

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[HX]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(X)-CH_{3}}$ ^alkenestoalkylhalides

- Example reaction:
- $\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[HCl] CH_{3}-CH(Cl)-CH_{3}}$ 
- Carbo Cation forms!
##### Mechanism
- [Alkanes to Alkyl Halides Mechanism](Alkanes%20to%20Alkyl%20Halides%20Mechanism.md)
#### Peroxides
- for now ignore peroxides.
- **Don't ignore HBr peroxide**
- For $\ce{HBr}$ always Anti Marconikoff product. ( No Rearrangement )
  1. This is known as the Marconikoff effect, Peroxide effect, Kharasch effect.
###### Source of Peroxide
3. $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$
4. $\ce{R-O-O-R}$
5. $\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-C(=O)-O-O-C(=O)-C_{6}H_{5}}$ -> Benzoic Peroxide

## Electrophilic Substitution

$\ce{R-CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2} + E+X- ->[suitable reagent]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R'-CH(E)-CH_{2}(X)}$^electrophilicsubstitutionofalkenes

This is it?
Maybe I'm not sure
hello
- Here $\ce{E}$ denotes electrophile part of molecule ( $\ce{E+}$ ) or cation and $\ce{X}$ denotes negative part of molecule ( $\ce{X-}$ ) 
- some famous $\ce{E+X-}$ include $\ce{ H+OH-, NO+Cl-, HO^{-}Cl+}$ and more
##### Mechanism
mechanism is [[Electrophilic substitution of Alkenes|here!]] 

## Epoxydation

$\ce{R=R' ->[Ag,473-673 K][O_{2}]}$ $\ce{R-(-O-)-R' ( its an epoxy group)}$^alkenestoepoxies

- Alkene apparently just adds an $\ce{O}$ into it like no big deal
