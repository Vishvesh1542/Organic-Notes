# Formation of Alkenes

## From Alkynes
$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} / Pd-C] R-CH=CH-R (cis alkene)}$^fromalkynestocisalkenes
- The $\ce{H_{2} /Pd-C}$ reagent is divided into two categories (**Rosenmund and Lindlar**)

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} +Na][liq. NH_{3}] R-CH=CH-R (trans alkene)}$^fromalkynestotransalkenes
- This is **Birch Reduction**

In both the reactions the reagents are strong reductants but both are requires for cis or trans alkene


## From Alkyl Halides
$\ce{CH_{3}-CHBr-CH_{3} ->[Alcoholic KOH][\Delta]} CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2}+HBr$^fromalkylhalidestoalkenes

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(Br)-CH_{3} ->[Alcoholic KOH][\Delta]} CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2}+HBr$^fromalkylhalidestoalkenes


# Chemical reactions of Alkenes

## Ozonolysis

### Reductive Ozonolysis ( default )
$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[(i) O_{3}][(ii) Zn-H_{2}O] CH_{3}-CH=O + CH_{2}=O}$ ^ozonolysisofalkenes
- Break the $\ce{=}$ bond and add $\ce{=O}$ to both the $\ce{C}$ atom.

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH-CH_{3} ->[(i) O_{3}][(ii) Zn-H_{2}O] 2CH_{3}CH=O}$

- When you have benzene with other bonds, try to break other bonds first.
```smiles
C1=CC=CC=C1C=C>>C1=CC=CC=C1C=O.C=O
```
- When you have no other bonds, Drastic conditions, and lots of $\ce{O_{3}}$ all three $\pi$ bonds will break in Benzene
```smiles
C1=CC=CC=C1>>O=CC=O.O=CC=O.O=CC=O
```
- In the above reaction, all $\pi$ bonds broke and attach $\ce{O}$ to all $\ce{C}$
### Mechanism

## To Alcohols
- There are three ways to convert Alkenes to Alcohols.
  1. $\ce{H_{2}O / H+}$ ( from Acids )
  2. $\ce{Hg(OAC)2 / H_{2}O / NaBH_{4}}$
  3. $\ce{B_{2}H_{6} , THF / H_{2}O_{2} / OH-}$
### Hydration
$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[H_{2}O / H+] CH_{3}-COH-CH_{3}}$ ^hydrationofalkenes
- This is a $\ce{C+}$ pathway!
#### Mechanism
![[Hydration]]
### Oxymercuration-Demercuration


$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[(i) Hg(OAC)2][(ii) H_{2}O \newline (iii) NaBH_{4}] CH_{3}-CH(OH)-CH_{3}}$ ^oxymercurationdemercuration

- $\ce{OH}$ always attaches to the $\ce{C}$ which has the lower number of $\ce{H}$ attached
- Also called "Marconikoff product"

#### Mechanism
![[oxymercuration-demercuration]]
### Hydroboration-Oxidation
$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{3} ->[(i) B_{2}H_{6} / THF][(ii) H_{2}O_{2} / OH-] CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-OH}$ ^hydroborationoxidation
- This is "Anti Marconikoff product". OH attaches to that C atom which has the higher number of H attached to it.

## To Alkyl Halides

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[HX] CH_{3}-CH(X)-CH_{3}}$ ^alkenestoalkylhalides

- Example reaction:
- $\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[HX] CH_{3}-CH(X)-CH_{3}}$ 
### Mechanism
- Electrophilic addition reaction
![[Alkenes to Alkyl Halides]]
### Peroxides
- for now ignore peroxides.
- **Don't ignore HBr peroxide**
- For $\ce{HBr}$ always Anti Marconikoff product. ( No Rearrangement )
  1. This is known as the Marconikoff effect, Peroxide effect, Kharasch effect.
#### Source of Peroxide
1. $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$
2. $\ce{R-O-O-R}$
3. $\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-C(=O)-O-O-C(=O)-C_{6}H_{5}}$ -> Benzoic Peroxide
