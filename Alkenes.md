# Formation  of Alkenes

## From Alkynes
$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} / Pd-C] R-CH=CH-R (cis alkene)}$^fromalkynestocisalkenes
- The $\ce{H_{2} /Pd-C}$ reagent is divided into two categories (**Rosenmund and Lindlar**)

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[H_{2} +Na][liq. NH_{3}] R-CH=CH-R (trans alkene)}$^fromalkynestotransalkenes
- This is **Birch Reduction**

In both the reactions the reagents are strong reductants but both are requires for cis or trans alkene


## From Alkyl Halides
$\ce{CH_{3}-CHBr-CH_{3} ->[Alcoholic KOH][\Delta]} CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2}+HBr$^fromalkylhalidestoalkenes
