# Preparation of Haloalkanes

## From Alkanes

$\ce{RH + X_{2}->[h\nu] R-X + HX}$

- Simple free radical Halogenation no questions asked
- Reactivity $\ce{F>Cl>Br\gg I}$

## From Alkenes/Alkynes

$\ce{R=R + ->[Br_{2}][CCl_{4}] R(-Br)-R(-Br)}$

- Very nice addition reaction we already know this

## From Alcohols

- There are 7 ways ðŸ’€

### 1) Lucas Reagent

$\ce{R-OH + HCl->[ZnCl_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + H_{2}O}$^lucasreaction

- This is called **Lucas reaction** as the reagent is Lucas reagent
- Mechanism is SN1

### 2) using NaBr

$\ce{R-OH + NaBr ->[H_{2}SO_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Br + NaHSO_{4}}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaNaBr

### 3) Using Phosphorous Trihalide

$\ce{3R-OH + PX_{3}->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{3R-X + H_{3}PO_{3}}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaPX3

- Reaction proceeds via SN2 mechanism
- $\ce{X}$ can be $\ce{Br_{2} or Cl_{2}}$

### 4) Using Phosphorous pentachloride

$\ce{R-OH + PCl_{5}}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + POCl_{3} +HCl}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaPCl5

- Mechanism depends on state of $\ce{PCl_{5}}$ its SNi for gas and SN2 for solid

### 5) Red phosphorous

$\ce{R-OH +X_{2} ->[Red P]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-X + By products}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaredP

### 6) Darjen's Method

$\ce{R-OH + SOCl_{2} ->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + SO_{2} + HCl}$^darjenmethod

- Best way to prepare alkyl halide as products are gases so easily purifiable
- Reaction is called **Darjen's method** and reagent is called **Thionyl Chloride**
- Reaction proceeds via SNi

### 7) Darjen's Method ( Pyridine )

$\ce{R-OH + SOCl_{2} ->[Pyridine]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + SO_{2} + HCl}$^darjenmethodpyridine

- Best way to prepare alkyl halide as products are gases so easily purifiable
- Reaction is called **Darjen's method** and reagent is called **Thionyl Chloride**
- Reaction proceeds via SN2
## Preparing Fluoroalkanes

$\ce{R-X ->[AgF or CoF_{3}][or Hg_{2}F_{2} or SbF_{3}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-F}$^Swartzreaction

- This is the BEST way to prepare Fluoroalkanes
- This reaction is called **Swartz Reaction**
- $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$

## Preparing Iodoalkanes

$\ce{R-X + NaI ->[dry acetone] }$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-I}$^Finkelsteinreaction

- This is called **Finkelstein Reaction** and proceeds via $\ce{SN^{2}}$ Mechanism
- dry acetone is solvent of reaction and cant dissolve $\ce{NaX}$ so backward reaction doesn't happen
-  $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$

## Preparing Bromoalkenes

$\ce{R-C(=O)-O^{-}Ag+ ->[Br_{2}][CCl_{4} or CS_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Br + AgBr + CO_{2}}$^Hunsdieckerreaction

- This is called **Boradine Hunsdiecker Reaction or Boradine Hunsdiecker Decarboxylation**
- The Substrate is known as "Silver salt of carboxylic acid"
- Reaction proceeds via **Free radical pathway**

## Preparing Allylic or Benzylic Halides

- For this we also have 3 reagents
- All these 3 follow radical pathway so watch out for resonance
- Benzylic > Allylic in stability so do substitution over benzylic if both given

### 1) Free Radical Halogenation

$\ce{CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2}->[X_{2},723K][h\nu \ or \Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviaX2

### 2) Sulfuryl Chloride

$\ce{CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2} + SO_{2}Cl_{2}->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviasulfurylchloride

### 3) NBS

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[NBS]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviaNBS

- NBS stands for **N-bromo succinamide**
