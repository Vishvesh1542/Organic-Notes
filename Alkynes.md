# Formation of Alkynes

## From Calcium Carbide

$\ce{CaCO_{3} ->[\Delta]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CaO + CO_{2}}$

$\ce{CaO + 2C ->}$%%qf%% $\ce{CaC_{2} + CO}$

$\ce{CaC_{2} + 2H_{2}O ->}$%%qf%%$\ce{HC#CH + Ca(OH)_{2}}$ ^fromcalciumcarbidetoalkynes

- Reaction of Calcium carbide( $\ce{CaC_{2}}$ ) with water is **Metathesis Reaction** ( Oxidation number doesn't change )

## From Vicinal Dihalides

$\ce{X-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-X ->[1)Alc.KOH \Delta][2)NaNH_{2}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH#CH}$ ^fromvicinaldihalidestoalkynes
- For vicinal dihalides we make use of strong bases ( $\ce{NaNH_{2}, KOH}$ ) 
- We can also use 2 Eq. of $\ce{NaNH_{2}}$ from the start for the same result
- Mechanism [[Alkynes from Vicinal Dihalides Mechanism|Here!]]


# Chemical Reactions of Alkynes

## Benzene
![[Making Mesitylene]] ^fromalkynestomesitylene


## Ozonolysis
$\ce{CH_{3}-C#CH ->[O_{3}][Me_{2}S]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}-C(O)-C(O)-H}$
- Only 2 bonds break and the single bond remains
- If you have Oxidative ozonolysis, convert aldehydes to Ketones and break $\ce{C-C}$ bond to form carboxylic acids if needed

## Alkynes to Halogens

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[X_{2}][CCl_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-C(X)=C(X)-R}$ ^fromalkynestotetrahalides

$\ce{R-C(X)=C(X)-R ->[X_{2}][CCl_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-C(X)_{2}-C(X)_{2}-R}$

- Any other non-polar and non reactive solvent can also be used in place of $\ce{CCl_{4}}$ 
- The reaction is always **Anti Addition** Reaction ( The alkene formed is always trans )

## Alkenes to Enol and Ketone

$\ce{HC#CH ->[dil. HgSO_{4}][H_{2}SO_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{2}=CH-OH ->[Instantly] CH_{3}-CHO}$^fromalkynestoenolstoketones

$\ce{R-C#CH ->[dil. HgSO_{4}][H_{2}SO_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{ R-C(-OH)=CH_{2} ->[Instantly] R-C(=O)-CH_{3}}$

- Polarize the alkyne such that the Carbocation is stable
- **Never** end the reaction at enol and move forward to forming Keto-form unless enol form is more stable due to aromaticity or other reasons
