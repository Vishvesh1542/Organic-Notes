# Formation of Alkynes

## From Calcium Carbide

$\ce{CaCO_{3} ->[\Delta] CaO + CO_{2}}$

$\ce{CaO + 2C -> CaC_{2} + CO}$

$\ce{CaC_{2} + 2H_{2}O -> HC#CH + Ca(OH)_{2}}$ ^fromcalciumcarbidetoalkynes

- Reaction of Calcium carbide( $\ce{CaC_{2}}$ ) with water is **Metathesis Reaction** ( Oxidation number doesn't change )

## From Vicinal Dihalides

- For vicinal dihalides we make use of strong bases ( $\ce{NaNH_{2}, KOH}$ ) 
![[Alkynes from Vicinal Dihalides]]
- We can also use 2 Eq. of $\ce{NaNH_{2}}$ from the start for the same result
