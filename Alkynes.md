# Formation of Alkynes

## From Calcium Carbide

$\ce{CaCO_{3} ->[\Delta]}$<!----> $\ce{CaO + CO_{2}}$
<!--SR:!2025-02-05,3,250-->

$\ce{CaO + 2C ->}$<!----> $\ce{CaC_{2} + CO}$
<!--SR:!2025-02-06,3,250-->

$\ce{CaC_{2} + 2H_{2}O ->}$ <!---->$\ce{HC#CH + Ca(OH)_{2}}$ ^fromcalciumcarbidetoalkynes
<!--SR:!2025-02-05,3,250-->

- Reaction of Calcium carbide( $\ce{CaC_{2}}$ ) with water is **Metathesis Reaction** ( Oxidation number doesn't change )

## From Vicinal Dihalides
$\ce{X-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-X ->[1)Alc.KOH \Delta][2)NaNH_{2}]}$<!----> $\ce{CH#CH}$ ^fromvicinaldihalidestoalkynes
<!--SR:!2025-02-06,4,270-->
- For vicinal dihalides we make use of strong bases ( $\ce{NaNH_{2}, KOH}$ ) 
- We can also use 2 Eq. of $\ce{NaNH_{2}}$ from the start for the same result

## Electrophilic addition of Alkynes

#### Halogens

$\ce{R-C#C-R ->[X_{2}][CCl_{4}] -> R-C(X)=C(X)-R ->[X_{2}][CCl_{4}] R-C(X)_{2}-C(X)_{2}-R}$ ^fromalkynestotetrahalides

- Any other non-polar and non reactive solvent can also be used in place of $\ce{CCl_{4}}$ 
- The reaction is always **Anti Adittion** Reaction ( The alkene formed is always trans )

#### Enol and Ketone

$\ce{HC#CH ->[dil. HgSO_{4}][H_{2}SO_{4}] CH_{2}=CH-OH ->[Instantly] CH_{3}-CHO}$

$\ce{R-C#CH ->[dil. HgSO_{4}][H_{2}SO_{4}] R-C(-OH)=CH_{2} ->[Instantly] R-C(=O)-CH_{3}}$

- Polarize the alkyne such that the Carbocation is stable
- **Never** end the reaction at enol and move forward to forming Keto-form unless enol form is more stable due to aromaticity or other reasons
