- They is the $\ce{R-NH_{2}}$ thingy
- They uh do lot a good things :)

# Preparation

## Hoffmann Bromamide Degradation Reaction

$\ce{Ar/R-C(=O)-NH_{2}->[1Br_{2}][4NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ar/R-NH_{2}}$^hoffmannbromamidedegradation

- We say this is Nitrene pathway but Nitrene never forms
- This reaction has 3 intermediates but major one is **Isocyanate** ( $\ce{-N=C=O}$ )
- 1 C atom was lost as $\ce{Na_{2}CO_{3}}$
- This reaction is **purely intramolecular** so if you take multiple different reactants only their corresponding amines form ( khud ka amide gives khud ka amine )

#### Mechanism
later

## Gabriel Phthalimide Reaction

- Firstly learn how to make phthalimide for this to happen
- Phthalimide looks like [[Common Names#Phthalimide|dis]]

$\ce{Phthalic Acid ->[NH_{3}][\Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalamide->[\Delta] Phthalimide}$^pthalicacidtopthalimide1

$\ce{Phthalic Acid->[(i)\Delta][(ii)NH_{3},\Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalimide}$ ^pthalicacidtopthalimide2

- Phthalic acid is o-Benzene dicarboxylic acid
- Now we can make amine

$\ce{Phthalimide->[KOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalimide anion}$^phthalimideanionprep

$\ce{Phthalimide anion->[RCl][SN_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-NH_{2} + Phthalic acid salt}$^phthalimidetoamine

- Since the RDS is $\ce{SN_{2}}$ step only **1 degree aliphatic amines** can be prepared using this
