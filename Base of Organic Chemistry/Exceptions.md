# Alkanes
- $\ce{F}$ in Alkyl Halides does not react with $\ce{Zn + H+}$
	  Because $\ce{F}$ reaction is very very exothermic and it will burn the container
- $\ce{I_{2}}$ and $\ce{F_{2}}$ are not used in Free Radical Halogenation of Alkanes due to 
	 1. Because $\ce{F_{2}}$ reactions are exothermic and will burn the container
	 2. Because $\ce{I_{2}}$ reactions are highly reversible due to formation of $\ce{HI}$ which is a VERY VERY strong acid
		 $\ce{HI}$ will attack the alkyl halide formed and reverse the reaction
		 To prevent this we add strong Oxidizing agent such as $\ce{conc.\ HNO_{3} or HIO_{4}}$
- To decide major products in halogenation of Alkanes
	1. For $\ce{F_{2}}$ choose the least sterically crowded $\ce{H}$
	2. For $\ce{Cl_{2}}$ and $\ce{Br_{2}}$ we have selectivity ratios
	3. $\ce{I_{2}}$ reaction are reversible so doesn't matter
- $\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared from Kolbe's electrolysis

# Alkenes

- $\ce{HBr}$ in presence of Peroxide source always forms anti-Markonikoff product when reacting with Alkenes, other Halogens don't care about peroxide source and react normally. this is called **Peroxide or Khalash Effect**
-  if **formic acid**( $\ce{HCOOH}$ ) forms in oxidative ozonolysis according to question oxidize it further to $\ce{HO-C(O)-OH}$ and $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$ if those are the options given 

# Alkynes

- No exceptions YAY! ( For now... )

# Benzene

- In Friedel Craft Acylation, some molecules like $\ce{(CH_{3})_{3}C-COCl}$ instead of normally forming the acyl cation( $\ce{(CH_{3})_{3}C-C^{+}O}$ ) LOSE Carbon moxoxide to form a more stable Carbocation ($\ce{(CH_{3})_{3}C+ +CO}$)
	- You can Visualize it [[Friedel Acylation Exception| and question your life here!]]
	- It also works if the more stable carbocation formed ( in the example t-butyl ) is more stable than t-butyl carbocation ( like aromatic carbocations and dancing resonance carbo cations )

## $\ce{LiAlH_{4}}$

- For some reason $\ce{LiAlH_{4}}$ decides to not be normal with Nitro-Benzene

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2}->[LiAlH_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-N=N-Ph ( Azobenzene )}$^nitrotoazobenzenebyLiAlH4

- For another some reason $\ce{LiAlH_{4}}$ decides to reduce alkene and alkyne of **Cinnamyl** groups even though script says it can't
- for info $\ce{Ph-CH=CH-R}$ is called cinnamyl group

$\ce{Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-OH->[LiAlH_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}OH}$^cinnamyltohydrocarbonbyLiAlH4

## $\ce{NaBH_{4}}$

- God knows why this guy reduces the unsaturation in **$\ce{\alpha,\beta}$ unsaturated Aldehyde/Ketone** 
- this is party explained by Resonance but still NO unsaturation survives

$\ce{R-CH=CH-C(=O)-R'->[NaBH_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}OH}$^NaBH4specialcase1

$\ce{R-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH=CH-R' ->[NaBH_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-CH(-OH)-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-R'}$^NaBH4specialcase2

- We have apparently found a workaround for this and now its called **Luche Reduction**
