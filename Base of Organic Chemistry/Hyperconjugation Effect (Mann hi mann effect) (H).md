- Definition - **The interaction of a C-H bond with a pi bond in that molecule itself**
- Only 5 systems show Hyperconjugation - **Carbocation ,Carbon free radical, Double bond, Triple bond and Benzene**
- It is an effect that depends on the number of Hydrogen attached to the $\alpha$ Carbon ( The carbon beside the system ) also called "enolizable Hydrogen"
- It is also called Baker-Nathan Effect, sigma-p resonance or no bond resonance
- Stability of structure is directly proportional to $\alpha$ Hydrogen or enolizable hydrogen

## How Hyperconjugation occurs

- it was first discovered by Baker-Nathan in prop-1-ene
- Basically "Man hi Man" H+ leaves from C

	$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[H+ leaves] CH_{2}^{-}-CH=CH_{2}}$

- Now the negative charge Resonates with the system (here its double bond)

	$\ce{CH_{2}^{-}-CH=CH_{2} <-> CH_{2}=CH-CH_{2}^{-}}$

- This makes the double bond more stable
