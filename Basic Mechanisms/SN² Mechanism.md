- Full birth name- **Substitution Nucleophilic Bimolecular Reaction**
- It is NOT a reaction but a MECHANISM that is shown by Alkyl Halides
- Intermediate is nothing :) just transition state
- It is a mechanism involving concerted ( bond breaking and bond forming takes place same time ) pathway

## Reaction itself

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-LG + Nu- ->[Strong Nu-][SN_{2}]}$ $\ce{CH_{3}-CH(Nu)-CH_{3} + LG-}$ 

- Here $\ce{LG}$ is leaving group, $\ce{Nu}$ is nucleophile and $\ce{R}$ is alkyl chain
### Mechanism

- There is no mechanism, leaving group leaving and Nucleophile attacking take place at same time
- so we get a **Trigonal Bipyramidal** Transition state but $\ce{sp^2}$ hybridized ( yes i know it sounds bonkers )

### Thermodynamics of SN2

- The overall reaction is **Exothermic** and **Spontaneous** as in net reaction you have broken one $\ce{R-LG}$ bond which is weaker than the $\ce{R-Nu}$ bond formed releasing more energy than consumed
- The Entropy of the system is almost constant so we can say $\ce{\Delta G}$ only depends on $\ce{\Delta H}$

### Kinetics of SN2

- The reaction is called "Bimolecular" as both the molecules participates in slow step (or the only step lol) , hence the "2" in SN2 represents molecularity
- since both participate in slow step $\ce{r=k[Substrate][Nucleophile]}$ meaning its **dependent** of both concentration of substrate and nucleophile

### Factors affecting rate of SN2

- There are 4 factors
#### 1) Nature of Substrate

- We want the transition state formed to be stable as its the only unstable thing
- So we want 3 things
	1. Stable Transition state
	2. Less steric crowdance
	3. electronically deficient Centre
- **VERY IMPORTANT**- In the transition state, $\ce{\pm}$M groups **CAN** show their resonance effect which can make its reactivity different

#### 2) Nature of Leaving group

- We want leaving group to be good so that it can leave and reaction can proceed
- Hence reactivity is $\ce{I>Br>Cl\gg F}$ for halogens as $\ce{C-F}$ bond is very strong
- Others can be checked by how stable they are after leaving

#### 3) Nature of Solvent

- **Polar Aprotic Solvents** are preferred as they have high dielectric constant which can polarize the $\ce{R-LG}$ bond easily making leaving group go away faster
- We don't want them to be protic as well the Nucleophile is strong so it will rather do acid base with the solvent

#### 4) Nature of Nucleophile

- The nucleophile must be **STRONG** as we want it so instantly displace the leaving group and attack itself without any intermediates

### Stereochemistry of SN2

- If a chiral carbon is formed then the stereochemistry is **Complete Inversion**
- This is also called Waldin inversion
- But the inversion isn't like R->S or S->R, the molecule in PLANE is literally inverted so a new configuration appears
- You cannot predict its specific rotation, how much it rotates light nothing
