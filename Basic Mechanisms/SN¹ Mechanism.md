- Full birth name- **Substitution Nucleophilic Unimolecular Reaction**
- It is NOT a reaction but a MECHANISM that is shown by Alkyl Halides
- Intermediate is $\ce{C+}$ so be **very careful**

## Reaction itself

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-LG + Nu- ->[Weak Nu-][SN^1]}$ $\ce{CH_{3}-CH(Nu)-CH_{3} + LG-}$ 

- Here $\ce{LG}$ is leaving group, $\ce{Nu}$ is nucleophile and $\ce{R}$ is alkyl chain
### Mechanism

**Step 1**- Form $\ce{C+}$ intermediate
$\ce{R-LG <->[slow][rds] R+ + LG-}$

**Step 2- ASK $\ce{C+}$ whether it wants to rearrange or not**
$\ce{R+ -> R+ (Rearranged)}$

**Step 3**- Attach the Leaving group
$\ce{R+(Rearranged) + Nu- -> R-Nu}$

### Thermodynamics of SN1

- The overall reaction is **Exothermic** and **Spontaneous** as in net reaction you have broken one $\ce{R-LG}$ bond which is weaker than the $\ce{R-Nu}$ bond formed releasing more energy than consumed
- The Entropy of the system is almost constant so we can say $\ce{\Delta G}$ only depends on $\ce{\Delta H}$
- We have 2 Transition states

### Kinetics of SN1

- The reaction is called "Unimolecular" as only 1 molecule participates in slow step, hence the "1" in SN1 represents molecularity
- since only substrate participates in slow step $\ce{r=k[Substrate]}$ meaning its **independent** of the concentration of Nucleophile

### Factors affecting rate of SN1

- There are 4 factors
#### 1) Nature of Substrate

- We want intermediate to be stable and since intermediate is $\ce{C+}$ the general Carbocation stability order is the order of rate of Sn1
- EXCEPT with molecules like $\ce{CH_{3}-CH(CH_{3})-CH_{2}-LG}$ in which the Beta Carbon is crowded or has 2 or more than 2 alkyl groups attached to it.
	 - Hence these are called **Advance 1 degree substrates or Beta crowded substrates** and they SHOW SN1 but slowly
- Steric crowdance favors SN1 as it makes leaving group go away faster. This is the reason Advanced 1 degree substrates show SN1
- Any Carbocation more unstable than Primary carbocation CANNOT show SN1 (except advance 1 degree)

#### 2) Nature of Leaving group

- We want leaving group to be good so that it can leave and reaction can proceed
- Hence reactivity is $\ce{I>Br>Cl\gg F}$ for halogens as $\ce{C-F}$ bond is very strong
- Others can be checked by how stable they are after leaving

#### 3) Nature of Solvent

- **Polar Aprotic Solvents** are preferred as they have high dielectric constant which can polarize the $\ce{R-LG}$ bond easily making leaving group go away faster
- They are also useful as after leaving group leaves it is CAGED by the solvent molecules unable to react with substrate again so make reaction go backward

#### 4) Nature of Nucleophile

- The nucleophile must be **WEAK** but not too weak as we know carbocation forms and does its thing so if nucleophile is strong it will not give time to form intermediate

### Stereochemistry of SN1

- If a chiral carbon is formed then the stereochemistry is **Partial Racemization**
- This is because the intermediate formed is Planar so Either nucleophile attacks top or bottom of plane giving 2 enantiomers
- It is partial because the nucleophile is STILL near the substrate so its easier to attack from opposite to the plane so avoid repulsions hence **Inversion is slightly greater than Retention**
- To make it racemize better we need the reaction to go faster so as to not give the other configuration a chance to form hence $\ce{\%Racemization \alpha \ SN^1 rate}$
