# Reactions of Benzene

- Benzene shows crack reactions but all of them come under **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction** and follow 3 steps
	1.  Formation of Electrophile
	2.  Formation of $\ce{\sigma}$-complex ( or Wheland Intermediate or Arenium ion)
	3.  Deprotonation of $\ce{\sigma}$-complex

## Fitting Reaction

$\ce{Ph-Cl + 2Na + Cl-Ph ->[Dry Ether]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Ph-Ph + 2NaCl}$ ^fittingreaction
<!--SR:!2025-02-22,4,280-->
- This is known as the Fitting Reaction

## Friedel Craft Alkylation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + Alkyl Halide ->[AlCl_{3}][ or FeCl_{3}]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Alkyl substituted Benzene}$^Friedelcraftalkylation
<!--SR:!2025-02-22,4,280-->

- For $\ce{AlCl_{3}}$ reaction follows **Carbocation ( $\ce{C+}$ )** pathway and for $\ce{FeCl_{3}}$ no notable pathway

##### Limitations of Friedel craft Alkylation

- Rearrangement may hinder some products formation
- since alkyl benzene is more reactive than benzene itself due to +I increasing electron density, if reagents are not calculated carefully it may lead to Polyalkylation[^1]
- Benzene with strong deactivating group like $\ce{NO_{2}}$ will not even show this reaction
- Aniline doesn't show Friedel craft alkylation as it itself reacts with $\ce{AlCl_{3} and FeCl_{3}}$ 
- **Vinyl and Aryl halide** never undergo this reaction as $\ce{C+}$ formed is very unstable

##### Reactivity of substances 
- The formation of $\ce{E+}$ electrophile happens in two steps:
	1. $\ce{R-X + AlCl_{3} -> R-X+-Al^--Cl_{3}}$
	2. $\ce{R-X+-Al^--Cl_{3} ->[stability]R+ + AlCl_{3}X-}$
	- Here, step one is slower and $\ce{X}$ is forming a coordinate bond.. Therefore, the reaction will be faster where X can more easily donate $\ce{e-}$ .
	- Since we are comparing along a group, size dominates therefore, more big the size, more easily it can accommodate the $\ce{e-}$.
	- reactivity: $F^{-}>Cl^{-} > Br^{-} > I-^{}$

## Friedel Craft Acylation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + Acyl Halide( R-COCl ) ->[AlCl_{3}]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Acyl substituted Benzene}$^Friedelcraftacylation
<!--SR:!2025-02-22,4,280-->

- Friedel craft acylation doesn't have polyalkylation due to product being more unreactive than reactant

##### Reactivity of substances
- The formation of $\ce{E+}$ electrophile happens in 1 step only:
	1. $\ce{R-OX + AlCl_{3} ->R-O+ + AlCl_{3}X-}$
	- Therefore, the reactivity depends on the leaving power of the group:
	  $I^- >Br^- >Cl^- >F^-$

## Sulphation/Sulphonation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} ->[conc. fuming H_{2}SO_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-SO_{3}H}$^Sulphationofbenzene
<!--SR:!2025-02-22,4,270-->

- Here second step is rate determining step but in isotopes of hydrogen third step also becomes slow as $\ce{C-H < C-D < C-T}$ in bond enthalpy, hence reactivity is given as $\ce{C_{6}H_{6} > C_{6}D_{6} > C_{6}T_{6}}$

## Nitration

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + HNO_{3} ->[conc.H_{2}SO_{4}][or an acid]}$%%qf%%$\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-NO_{2}}$^Nitrationofbenzene
<!--SR:!2025-02-22,4,270-->


- Other reagents like $\ce{BF_{3} + FNO_{2}, N_{2}O_{5}}$ and strong acids in presence of $\ce{HNO_{3}}$ also aid in nitration
- Aniline forms o-nitro ( 2% ), m-nitro ( 47% ) and p-nitro ( 51% ) because aniline reacts with acid instead of nitric acid doing so
- If you ONLY want p-nitro aniline first do acylation of aniline for acyl group to attach to $\ce{NH_{2}}$ and then do nitration to get 95% of p-nitro aniline product
- formation of sigma complex is slowest and rate determining step for all isotopes of hydrogen

[^1]: Polyalkynation
	When the same benzene gets attached with more than one Alkane, it is called polyalkynation. Example Xylene
