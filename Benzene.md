# Reactions of Benzene

- Benzene shows crack reactions but all of them come under **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction** and follow 3 steps
	1.  Formation of Electrophile
	2.  Formation of $\ce{\sigma}$-complex ( or Wheland Intermediate or Arenium ion)
	3.  Deprotonation of $\ce{\sigma}$-complex

## Fitting Reaction

$\ce{Ph-Cl + 2Na + Cl-Ph ->[Dry Ether]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Ph-Ph + 2NaCl}$ ^fittingreaction
- This is known as the Fitting Reaction

   ```

## Wurtz-Fitting Reaction

$\ce{Ph-Cl + 2Na + Cl-CH_{3} ->[Dry Ether]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Ph-CH_{3} + 2NaCl}$ ^wurtzfittingreaction
```smiles

## Friedel Craft Alkylation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + Alkyl Halide ->[AlCl_{3}][ or FeCl_{3}]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Alkyl substituted Benzene}$^Friedelcraftalkylation

- For $\ce{AlCl_{3}}$ reaction follows **Carbocation ( $\ce{C+}$ )** pathway and for $\ce{FeCl_{3}}$ no notable pathway

##### Limitations of Friedel craft Alkylation

- Rearrangement may hinder some products formation
- since alkyl benzene is more reactive than benzene itself sue to +I increasing electron density, if reagents are not calculated carefully it may lead to **polyalkylation**
- Benzene with strong deactivating group like $\ce{NO_{2}}$ will not even show this reaction
- **Aniline** doesn't show Friedel craft alkylation as it itself reacts with $\ce{AlCl_{3} and FeCl_{3}}$ 
- **Vinyl and Aryl halide** never undergo this reaction as $\ce{C+}$ formed is very unstable

##### Mechanism

## Friedel Craft Acylation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + Acyl Halide( R-COCl ) ->[AlCl_{3}]}$%%qf%% $\ce{Acyl substituted Benzene}$^Friedelcraftacylation

- Friedel craft acylation doesn't have polyalkylation due to product being more unreactive than reactant

## Sulphation/Sulphonation

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} ->[conc. fuming H_{2}SO_{4}]}$%%qf%%$\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-SO_{3}H}$^Sulphationofbenzene

## Nitration

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + HNO_{3} ->[conc.H_{2}SO_{4}][or an acid]}$%%qf%%$\ce{C_{6}H_{5}-NO_{2}}$^Nitrationofbenzene
<!--SR:!2025-02-15,4,282-->

- Other reagents like $\ce{BF_{3} + FNO_{2}, N_{2}O_{5}}$ and strong acids in presence of $\ce{HNO_{3}}$ also aid in nitration
- Aniline forms o-nitro ( 2% ), m-nitro ( 47% ) and p-nitro ( 51% ) because aniline reacts with acid instead of nitric acid doing so
- If you ONLY want p-nitro aniline **WhAT??**
##### Mechanism

- Is it a bird? Is it a plane? no its the [[Nitration of Benzene Mechanism| Mechanism of Nitration]]
