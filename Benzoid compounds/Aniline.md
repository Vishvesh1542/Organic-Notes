# Reactions

## Friedel Craft

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[RCl or RCOCl][AlCl_{3}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{NOTHING!}$^anilinefriedelcrafts

- Same reason as phenol aniline is a Lewis base reacts with $\ce{AlCl_{3}}$ a Lewis acid

## Nitration

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[conc.HNO_{2}][H_{2}SO_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{ p-nitro Aniline + m-nitro Aniline}$^nitrationofalinine

- Meta is major as aniline converts to Anilinium ion ( Aniline's Conjugate acid ) which is deactivating
- Also the exact percentage composition in nitration of aniline is %%qf%% $\ce{m-nitro aniline 47}$%, $\ce{p-nitro aniline 51}$%,$\ce{o-nitro aniline 2}$%

## Sulphonation

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[conc. fuming H_{2}SO_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{p-amino Benzene Sulphonic acid}$^anilinesulphonation

- The mechanism of this is NOT same, firstly acid base happens then $\ce{SO_{3}H}$ group migrates to para position on heating
- Also this molecule exists in Zwitter ion form due to intra acid base

## Bromination

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[Br_{2}][H_{2}O]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{2,4,6-tribromo Aniline ( white ppt )}$^brominationofaniline

- Even if you give in non polar solvent doesn't matter still tri bromo product
- If you desperately need it do acetylation to weaken the activating of N and then do bromination

## Diazotization

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[NaNO_{2},conc. HCl][273K - 278K]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-[N#N]+Cl-}$

- this thing has so many damn reactions, many of which were given in other sections, but here are some more

$\ce{Ph-[N#N]+Cl-->[H_{3}PO_{2} or CH_{3}CH_{2}OH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{C_{6}H_{6} + H_{3}PO_{3} or CH_{3}C(=O)H +N_{2} + HCl}$^reductionofBDC
