#organic 

- $\ce{Ph-OH}$ pyar se called carbolic acid

# Preparation

## From Chloro Benzene

![[Reactions of Aryl Halides#Dow's Process ( Haloarene -> Phenol )]]

## From Aniline

$\ce{Ph-NH_{2}->[i)NaNO_{2},HCl][ii)H_{2}O,\Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-OH}$

## From Cumene

$\ce{Ph-CH(-CH_{3})2 ->[O_{2}][h\nu]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-C(-O-OH)(-CH_{3})2 ->[H+] Ph-OH + CH_{3}-C(=O)-CH_{3}}$

### Mechanism
Soonish

# Reactions

## Reimer Tieman

$\ce{Phenol ->[CHCl_{3}][NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{ortho (Cl)2-CH-Ph-O^-Na+ ->[NaOH] ortho O=CH-Ph-O^-Na+ ->[H+][Workup] ortho O=CH-Ph-OH (salicylaldehyde)}$
- ortho is major due to intra H bonding
### Mechanism
Sonish
## Reimer Tieman part 2

$\ce{Ph-OH->[CCl_{4}][4NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Salicylic Acid}$

- Reaction happens due to dipole-dipole interaction 
- This reaction is not that famous as dipole-dipole interaction is not a very valid reason for a reaction to happen with this much yield ( and cuz there was stupid politics at that time )

## Kolbe's Reaction

$\ce{Ph-OH->[CO_{2}][NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Salicylic acid}$

- This is much better to visualize as Electrophile-Nucleophile reaction

### Mechanism
soohins

## Kolbe-Schmidt

$\ce{Ph-OH->[CO_{2}][393-413K, 5-7atm]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Salicylic acid}$

- Same mechanism as Kolbe's reaction but no wasting $\ce{NaOH}$
