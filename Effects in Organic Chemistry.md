## Inductive Effect (I)

- Definition- **"Polarization of $\ce{\sigma}$ bond due to polarization of adjacent $\ce{\sigma}$ bond"**
- It is the effect that is distant dependent and works for $\ce{\sigma}$ bonded electrons
- It depends on electronegativity and distance
- to compare Inductive effect we use **DNS** priority rule ( Distance > Number > Size )
- It is of 2 types, $\ce{+I}$ ( dene wala ) and $\ce{-I}$ ( lene wala )
- Reference to determine + or - $\ce{I}$ is $\ce{-CH_{2}-Cl}$
### Order of -I

$\ce{NF_{3}+ > NR_{3}+ > SR_{2}+ > NH_{3}+}$ %% Charged Species > others %%
$\ce{NO_{2} > SO_{3}H > CN > -HC=O > -C(=O)-  > -COOH }$ 
$\ce{F > Cl > Br > I }$  %% Halogens (electronegativity) %%
$\ce{-OR > -OH > -C#CH > NH_{2} > -PH > -CH=CH_{2} > H}$ %%H is reference%%
### Order of +I

$\ce{-CH_{2}^- > -NH^- > -O^- > -COO^- > CR_{3} > CR_{2}H > CRH_{2} > CH_{3} > D > H}$

## Resonance / Mesomeric effect ( R or M )

- Definition- **"Phenomena of delocalization of conjugated $\pi$ electrons"**
- When single structure cant explain all properties of molecule we use resonance structures
- None of the canonical structures exist , their hybrid called "Resonance Hybrid" exists
- More stable Resonance Structure, more its contribution in the hybrid
- It is also of 2 types, $\ce{+M , +R}$ or $\ce{-M , -R}$
- Reference to check $\ce{+M or -M}$ is $\ce{-CH=CH_{2}}$
 
### Rules of Resonance

- Resonance only occurs in **Planar systems**
- Net charge, arrangement of atoms, number of paired and unpaired electrons, hybridization of an atom all remain unchanged
- Do NOT exceed octet of 2nd period elements in resonance
- In molecules where all resonance atructures are equal, net charge can be calculated on each atom and bond order given by 
$$\ce{1 + \left(\frac{no. of \pi\ bond}{no. of \sigma\ bonds in the system}  \right) = \frac{No. of bonds in resonance}{No. of resonance structures}}$$

### Rules to determine stability of Resonance Structures

1. More $\pi$ bonds in conjugated system $\implies$ more stable
2. Complete octet R.S are more stable
3. Neutral R.S are more stable
4. If charged:
   - Comparison along group $\implies$ Size dominates
   - Comparison in period $\implies$ E.N dominates
5. Aromatic R.S are more stable
6. 
   - Negative charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E-}$ withdrawing groups
   - Positive charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E+}$ donating groups
7. Linear Conjugation $>$ Cross Conjugation
### Resonance Energy

- Definition- **"The energy difference between the most stable resonance structure and the resonance hybrid"**
- Known Values

|    Molecule    | Resonance Energy ( KCal ) |
| :------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Benzene     |            36             |
|   Napthalene   |            61             |
|   Anthracene   |            84             |
|  Phenanthrene  |            92             |
| Buta-1,3-diene |             4             |
### Order of +M

$\ce{C- > N- > O- >}$ %% Charged species always first %%
$\ce{-NH_{2} > -NHR > -NR_{2} >}$ %% Steric crowding %%
$\ce{ OH > OR >}$  %% Electronegativity + Steric Crowding %%
$\ce{-NH-C(=O)-R > -O-C(=O)-R >}$ %% Electronegativity %%
$\ce{-Ph > -C#C > -C=C >}$ %% more number of pi bonds %%
$\ce{-F > -Cl > -Br > -I >}$ %% overlapping of orbitals > Electronegativity %%
$\ce{-N=C}$ %% intramolecular resonance %%

### Order of -M

$\ce{-NO_{2} > -CN > -SO_{3}H >}$ %% top 3 experimentally %%
$\ce{-CHO > -C(=O)R > -C(=O)-O-C(=O)-R > -C(=O)-OR > -C(=O)-NH_{2} > -C(=O)-O- }$ %% intra-resonance + electronegativity %%
$\ce{ > -C#C > -Ph > -C=C}$ %% Electronegativity %%
