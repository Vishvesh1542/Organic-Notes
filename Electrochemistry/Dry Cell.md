Also called as **G-Leclanche's** Cell

It consists of an inner $\ce{C}$ cathode and outer $\ce{Zn}$ anode.

# Reactions

## Anode
$\ce{Zn -> Zn^{+2} + 2e-}$

## Cathode 
$\ce{2e- + MnO_{2} + NH_{4}+ -> MnO(OH) + NH_{3}}$



- The concentration of ions changes, therefore, the Cell voltage is not constant
