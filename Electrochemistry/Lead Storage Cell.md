**Anode**: $\ce{Pb}$
**Cathode**: $\ce{PbO_{2}}$
**Medium**: $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$
# Reaction
## Anode
$\ce{Pb -> Pb^{+2} + 2e-}$
This $\ce{Pb^{+2}}$ again reacts with $\ce{SO_{4}^{2-}}$
$\ce{Pb^{2+} + SO_{4}^{2-} -> PbSO_{4}}$

Balance in Acidic medium

## Cathode
$\ce{PbO_{2} + 2e- ->Pb^{+2} }$

Again forms $\ce{PbSO_{4}}$


# Reversibility
If we provide charge, then the reverse reaction happens in both the cases and we "charge" the cell.

If density of $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$ < 1.2 g/mol, then we need to recharge
