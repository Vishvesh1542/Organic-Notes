# Alkanes
- $\ce{F}$ in Alkyl Halides does not react with $\ce{Zn + H+}$
	  Because $\ce{F}$ reaction is very very exothermic and it will burn the container
	  in ![[Alkanes#^fromalkylhalidestoalkanes]]

- $\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared from Kolbe's electrolysis
	![[Alkanes#^fromcarboxylicacidstoalkanes]]
