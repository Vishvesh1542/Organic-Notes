# Alkanes
- $\ce{F}$ in Alkyl Halides does not react with $\ce{Zn + H+}$
	  Because $\ce{F}$ reaction is very very exothermic and it will burn the container
<<<<<<< HEAD
- $\ce{I_{2}}$ and $\ce{F_{2}}$ are not used in Free Radical Halogenation of Alkanes due to 
	 1. Because $\ce{F_{2}}$ reactions are exothermic and will burn the container
	 2. Because $\ce{I_{2}}$ reactions are highly reversible due to formation of $\ce{HI}$ which is a VERY VERY strong acid
		 $\ce{HI}$ will attack the alkyl halide formed and reverse the reaction
		 To prevent this we add strong Oxidizing agent such as $\ce{conc.\ HNO_{3} or HIO_{4}}$
# Alkenes
- $\ce{CH_{4}}$ can never be prepared from Kolbe's electrolysis
