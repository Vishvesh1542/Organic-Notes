Part of #organic 

- $\ce{R-Mg-X}$ is called Grignard's reagent ( Where R can be almost anything )
- Example: $\ce{CH_{3}-Mg-Br}$ 
- It is an Organo-metallic compound ( $\ce{C-metal}$ bond compound )

# Preparation of Grignard's Reagent
$\ce{R-X + Mg ->[dry][ether]}$%%qf%%$\ce{R-MgX}$

$\ce{CH_{3}^{\delta+}-Br^{\delta-} + Mg->[dry][ether]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}^{\delta-}-Mg^{\delta+}X}$
- The Carbon has a $\ce{\delta+}$ before and has a $\ce{\delta-}$ charge ( it's polarity changed ). 
- This type of things are called **Umpolung Reaction** 

## Reactivity
For preparation of G.R, because bond between $\ce{C-X}$ is being broken, the weaker the bond, the easier.
- $\ce{C-I > C-Br > C-Cl \gg C-F}$

- The weaker the bond, the easier to prepare.


# Reaction of Grignard's Reagent
## Reactivity
The more unstable the G.R, the more reactive.
Since, $\ce{R^{\delta-}}-Mg^{\delta+}X$ is there, the more unstable the $\ce{R^{\delta-}}$ the more reactive, the G.R
