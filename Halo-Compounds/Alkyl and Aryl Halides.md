# Preparation of Haloalkanes

## From Alkanes
![[Alkanes#Free Radical Halogenation Disproportionation ( Substitution ) Reaction]]
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

![[Alkenes#To Alkyl Halides]]

![[Alkynes#Alkynes to Halogens]]

## From Alcohols

- There are 7 WHOLE reagents just for this ðŸ’€
- You can check them out [[Preparation Of Alkyl Halides from Alcohol|here!]]
## Preparing Fluoroalkanes

$\ce{R-X ->[AgF or CoF_{3}][or Hg_{2}F_{2} or SbF_{3}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-F}$^Swartzreaction

- This is the BEST way to prepare Fluoroalkanes
- This reaction is called **Swartz Reaction**
- $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$
## Preparing Bromoalkenes

$\ce{R-C(=O)-O^{-}Ag+ ->[Br_{2}][CCl_{4} or CS_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Br + AgBr + CO_{2}}$^Hunsdieckerreaction

- This is called **Boradine Hunsdiecker Reaction or Boradine Hunsdiecker Decarboxylation**
- The Substrate is known as "Silver salt of carboxylic acid"
- Reaction proceeds via **Free radical pathway**
## Preparing Iodoalkanes

$\ce{R-X + NaI ->[dry acetone] }$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-I}$^Finkelsteinreaction

- This is called **Finkelstein Reaction** and proceeds via $\ce{SN^{2}}$ Mechanism
- dry acetone is solvent of reaction and cant dissolve $\ce{NaX}$ so backward reaction doesn't happen
-  $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$

## Preparing Allylic or Benzylic Halides

- For this we also have 3 reagents
- All these 3 follow radical pathway so watch out for resonance
- Benzylic > Allylic in stability so do substitution over benzylic if both given

### 1) Free Radical Halogenation

$\ce{CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2}->[X_{2},723K][h\nu \ or \Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviaX2

### 2) Sulfuryl Chloride

$\ce{CH_{2}-CH=CH_{2} + SO_{2}Cl_{2}->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviasulfurylchloride

### 3) NBS

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH=CH_{2} ->[NBS]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{CH_{2}(-X)-CH=CH_{2}}$^allylichalogenationviaNBS

- NBS stands for **N-bromo succinamide**

# Preparation of Halo-arenes

- There are n- number of ways to do this

## From Benzene

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} ->[X_{2}][AlCl_{3} or FeCl_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-X + HX}$^halogenationofbenzene

- $\ce{X_{2}}$ can be $\ce{Br_{2} or Cl_{2}}$
- Intermediate is $\ce{\sigma-complex}$

#### Other reactions 

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6}->[X_{2}][Fe (Dark)]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-X}$^darkhalogenationofbenzene

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6} ->[Cl_{2} excess][FeCl_{3}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{C_{6}Cl_{6} (Hexa Chloro Benzene)}$^prepofhexachlorobenzene

$\ce{C_{6}H_{6}->[Cl_{2}][UV,500K]}$ %%sf%% $\ce{C_{6}H_{6}Cl_{6} (gammaxene)}$^prepofgammaxene

## From Aniline

- To do anything with aniline we first convert into the Bhramastra which is **Benzene Diazonium Chloride**
- More on that [[Preparation Of Aryl Halides from Aniline|here!]]
