### 1) Lucas Reagent

$\ce{R-OH + HCl->[ZnCl_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + H_{2}O}$^lucasreaction

- This is called **Lucas reaction** as the reagent is Lucas reagent
- Mechanism is [[SN¹ Mechanism]]
- Racemization occurs

### 2) using NaBr

$\ce{R-OH + NaBr ->[H_{2}SO_{4}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Br + NaHSO_{4} + H_{2}O}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaNaBr

### 3) Using Phosphorous Trihalide

$\ce{3R-OH + PX_{3}->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{3R-X + H_{3}PO_{3}}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaPX3

- Reaction proceeds via SN2 mechanism
- $\ce{X}$ can be $\ce{Br_{2} or Cl_{2}}$

### 4) Using Phosphorous pentachloride

$\ce{R-OH + PCl_{5}}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + POCl_{3} +HCl}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaPCl5

- Mechanism depends on state of $\ce{PCl_{5}}$ its [[SN¹ Mechanism|SN1]] for gas and [[SN2 Mechanism|SN2]] for solid

### 5) Red phosphorous

$\ce{R-OH +X_{2} ->[Red P]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-X + By products}$^alcoholtoalkylhalideviaredP
- This is actually [[#3) Using Phosphorous Trihalide]] as $\ce{X_{2} + \mathrm{Re}d P -> PX_{3}}$

### 6) Darjen's Method

$\ce{R-OH + SOCl_{2} ->}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + SO_{2} + HCl}$^darjenmethod

- Best way to prepare alkyl halide as products are gases so easily purifiable
- Reaction is called **Darjen's method** and reagent is called **Thionyl Chloride**
- Reaction proceeds via [[SN¹ Mechanism|SN1]]

### 7) Darjen's Method ( Pyridine )

$\ce{R-OH + SOCl_{2} ->[Pyridine]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Cl + SO_{2} + HCl}$^darjenmethodpyridine

- Best way to prepare alkyl halide as products are gases so easily purifiable
- Reaction is called **Darjen's method** and reagent is called **Thionyl Chloride**
- Reaction proceeds via [[SN2 Mechanism|SN2]]
