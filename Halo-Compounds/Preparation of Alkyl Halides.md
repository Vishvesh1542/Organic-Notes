## From Alkanes

![[Alkanes#Free Radical Halogenation Disproportionation ( Substitution ) Reaction]]
## From Alkenes/Alkynes

![[Alkenes#To Alkyl Halides]]

![[Alkynes#Alkynes to Halogens]]

## From Alcohols

- There are 7 WHOLE reagents just for this ðŸ’€
- You can check them out [[Preparation Of Alkyl Halides from Alcohol|here!]]
## Preparing Fluoroalkanes

$\ce{R-X ->[AgF or CoF_{3}][or Hg_{2}F_{2} or SbF_{3}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-F}$^Swartzreaction

- This is the BEST way to prepare Fluoroalkanes
- This reaction is called **Swartz Reaction**
- $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$
## Preparing Bromoalkenes

$\ce{R-C(=O)-O^{-}Ag+ ->[Br_{2}][CCl_{4} or CS_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-Br + AgBr + CO_{2}}$^Hunsdieckerreaction

- This is called **Boradine Hunsdiecker Reaction or Boradine Hunsdiecker Decarboxylation**
- The Substrate is known as "Silver salt of carboxylic acid"
- Reaction proceeds via **Free radical pathway**
## Preparing Iodoalkanes

$\ce{R-X + NaI ->[dry acetone] }$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-I}$^Finkelsteinreaction

- This is called **Finkelstein Reaction** and proceeds via $\ce{SN^{2}}$ Mechanism
- dry acetone is solvent of reaction and cant dissolve $\ce{NaX}$ so backward reaction doesn't happen
-  $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Br or Cl}$
