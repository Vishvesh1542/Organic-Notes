- Alkyl halides show 3 types of reactions
	1.  Nucleophilic Substitution reaction
	2. Elimination reactions
	3. Reaction with metals

## Nucleophilic substitution reactions

- These come in variety of different mechanisms, the ones we know are $\ce{SN_{1}}$ , $\ce{SN_{2}}$ , $\ce{SN_{i}}$ , $\ce{SN_{2}Th}$ and $\ce{SN_{{NGP}}}$ 

- Watch $\ce{SN_{1}}$ for yourself [[SN¹ Mechanism|here!]]
- Analyze $\ce{SN_{2}}$ for yourself [[SN² Mechanism|right here!]]
- Want to know how $\ce{SN_{{i}}}$ , $\ce{SN_{2}Th}$ and $\ce{SN_{NGP}}$ for yourself? , they are basically derivatives of $\ce{SN_{2}}$ so go [[SN² Mechanism|here!]]

## Elimination Reactions

- These also come in variety of different mechanisms, the ones we know are $\ce{E_{1}}$,$\ce{E_{2}}$,$\ce{E_{1CB}}$ and $\ce{Ei}$
- **BOTH** Substitution and Elimination reactions run parallel to each other ONLY temperature decides which product is major

## Reaction with Metals

- Alkyl halides can react with metals like $\ce{Ag}$, $\ce{Mg}$ and others to form interesting reagents

### With Mg

- This forms **Grignard Reagent**

![[Grignard's Reagent]]

### With Ag

- Alkyl Halides react with Ag in form of $\ce{AgNO_{3}}$ via SN1

$\ce{R-X +AgNO_{3}->[SN_{1}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-NO_{3} + AgX}$^alkylhalideswithAgNO3

- This $\ce{AgX}$ has some cool stuff going on with it
	 - $\ce{AgF}$ is highly soluble in water
	 - $\ce{AgCl}$ is white in color
	 - $\ce{AgBr}$ is pale yellow in color
	 - $\ce{AgI}$ is yellow in color
