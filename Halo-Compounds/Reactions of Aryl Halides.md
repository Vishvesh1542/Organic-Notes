apparently there's only 1 reaction?

## Dow's Process ( Haloarene -> Phenol )

$\ce{Ph-Cl->[NaOH][623K 300atm]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-OH}$^Dowsprocess

- The conditions are so drastic that NaOH instead of doing acid-base does $\ce{SN_{2}Ar}$ 
- Presence of electron withdrawing groups increases reactivity
- Below are similar to dow's process but aren't dow's process

$\ce{para NO_{2}-Ph-Cl->[NaOH][443K]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{para NO_{2}-Ph-OH}$

$\ce{ortho,para (NO_{2})2-Ph-Cl->[NaOH][368 K]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{ortho,para (NO_{2})2-Ph-OH}$

$\ce{ortho,ortho,para (NO_{2})3-Ph-Cl->[warm H_{2}O]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Picric acid}$
