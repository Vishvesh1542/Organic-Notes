This is the process by which we do a acid-base reaction such that the metal oxidizes

For example, We have $\ce{CuO}$ ore with $\ce{FeO}$ impurities.
How to remove iron impurity?
$\ce{CuO + FeO(bad) + SiO_{2} [flux] -> CuO FeSiO_{3}}$
- Why $\ce{SiO_{2}}$?
- Because $\ce{FeO}$ is basic in nature, so we add acidic flux.

# Slag
- It has low density
- Floats on top
- Can easily be removed
- immiscible in metal
- Acts like protection against air

Most common flux used is $\ce{SiO_{2}}$

# NOTE
$\ce{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ does not react with flux! So, if you have $\ce{Fe}$ metal and want to remove impurities, convert it to $\ce{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ such that it doesn't react with flux!
