# Froth Flotation:
- Used for sulphide ores
- Basically, the ore is not soluble in water, so **Pine oil** Is added such that it floats in the pine oil to the top.
- **adsorption** takes place, where only the surface of the metal adsorbs pine oil (sticks on surfac e)
- Ore and froth ( oil ) will float on top while impurities ( gangue ) is settled at bottom
- To increase **non-wetability** of the ore $\ce{Na | K}$ ethyl Xanthate ($\ce{C_{2}H_{5}-O-C(=O})-S^- Na^+$)
- To prevent froth from reacting with metal, froth stabilizers like Aniline, Cresol are added

## Multi Metal extraction
- When we have 2 metals like $\ce{ZnS}$ and $\ce{PbS}$ how to separate them?
### Dissolving the metal
- We first dissolve one of the metals ($\ce{ZnS}$) by using $\ce{NaCN | Na_{2}CO_{3}}$

$\ce{PbS ->[NaCN] NO RXN}$

$\ce{ZnS ->[NaCN]Na_{2}[Zn(CN)4]}$
- This complex is soluble in water and thus, dissolves
- Here $\ce{NaCN | Na_{2}CO_{3}}$ is a **Depressant**
- We can safely extract $\ce{PbS}$

### Regaining the metal
- After $\ce{PbS}$ has been extracted, we can get our $\ce{Zn}$ back:
- We add activator ($\ce{CuSO_{4}}$)

$\ce{Na_{2}[Zn(CN)4] ->[CuSO_{4}] ZnS\downarrow + Na_{3}[Cu(CN)4]}$
- Here, $\ce{Na_{3}[Cu(CN)4]}$ is soluble in water
