# Leaching
- Used for $\ce{Al | Ag | Au}$
- Basic principle is, we oxidise the ore, then it becomes soluble in water, then we again reduce it.

## Leaching of Ag | Au
$\ce{Ag + impurity + NaCN(aq) + O_{2} -> Na[Ag(CN)2](aq) + impurity\downarrow}$
Similar with $\ce{Au}$
- Here $\ce{O_{2}}$ acts as an oxidising agent
- Notice that $\ce{Ag}$ goes from 0 oxidation state to +1

After that, to get back our metal, we just reduce it.
$\ce{Na[Ag(CN)2] ->[Zn][or any low R.P] Ag +Na_{2}[Zn(CN)4]}$

- If we do the same for $\ce{Au}$, it is called **MAF cyanide process** (Mac Arthur Forest)

### Exception for an ore
If we have $\ce{Ag_{2}S + NaCN + O_{2}}$ you might be tempted to say $\ce{O_{2}}$ acts as an oxidizing agent. But notice that $\ce{Ag}$ doesn't change Oxidation state here:

$\ce{Ag_{2}S + NaCN + O_{2} -> Na[Ag(CN)2] + Na_{2}S}$

Instead, it increases the rate of forward reaction by reacting with the $\ce{Na_{2}S}$
$\ce{Na_{2}S + O_{2} -> Na_{2}SO_{4}}$


## Leaching of Al
Used for only RED bauxite ( high is $\ce{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ content )
it is slightly different

We have two processes

### Bayer's Process
- $\ce{NaOH}$ is used as the leaching agent.

$\ce{Al_{2}O_{3} + 2H_{2}O + NaOH ->[acid base] Na[Al(OH)4]}$
- $\ce{Na[Al(OH)4]}$ exists as $\ce{NaAlO_{2}.2H_{2}O}$
- After removing insoluble impurities, we get $\ce{Al}$ back

Now, the $\ce{NaAlO_{2}}$ reacts with $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O (H_{2}CO_{3})}$
$\ce{NaAlO_{2}.2H_{2}O + H_{2}CO_{3} -> Al(OH)3}\downarrow + Na_{2}CO_{3}$ 

- The $\ce{Al(OH)3}$ can be removed as its in ppt. form
- It exists as $\ce{Al_{2}O_{3}.xH_{2}O}$


### Halls Process
- Basically the same, but we use $\ce{Na_{2}CO_{3}}$ ( exists as $\ce{Na_{2}O.CO_{2}}$ which forms $\ce{NaOH}$ after hydrolysis ) instead
