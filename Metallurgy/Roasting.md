- Process of heating the ore in the presence or excess of $\ce{O_{2}}$
- Used for $\ce{ZnS | Cu_{2}S}$ etc.
- Basically when the ore doesn't have $\ce{O_{2}}$ use roasting
- Also, this process also helps in removing of volatile-compounds

Roasting, along with [[Calcination|calcination]] makes the ore porous by letting all the volatile impurities evaporate and also increases the surface area which is helpful for us later.
