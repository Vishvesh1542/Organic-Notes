- They is the $\ce{R-NH_{2}}$ thingy
- They uh do lot a good things :)

# Preparation

## Hoffmann Bromamide Degradation Reaction

$\ce{Ar/R-C(=O)-NH_{2}->[1Br_{2}][4NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ar/R-NH_{2}}$^hoffmannbromamidedegradation

- We say this is Nitrene pathway but Nitrene never forms
- This reaction has 3 intermediates but major one is **Isocyanate** ( $\ce{-N=C=O}$ )
- 1 C atom was lost as $\ce{Na_{2}CO_{3}}$
- This reaction is **purely intramolecular** so if you take multiple different reactants only their corresponding amines form ( khud ka amide gives khud ka amine )
- Since it is intramolecular, stereochemistry is **Retention**

#### Mechanism
later

## Gabriel Phthalimide Reaction

- Firstly learn how to make phthalimide for this to happen
- Phthalimide looks like [[Common Names#Phthalimide|dis]]

$\ce{Phthalic Acid ->[NH_{3}][\Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalamide->[\Delta] Phthalimide}$^pthalicacidtopthalimide1

$\ce{Phthalic Acid->[(i)\Delta][(ii)NH_{3},\Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalimide}$ ^pthalicacidtopthalimide2

- Phthalic acid is o-Benzene dicarboxylic acid
- Now we can make amine

$\ce{Phthalimide->[KOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Phthalimide anion}$^phthalimideanionprep

$\ce{Phthalimide anion->[RCl][SN_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-NH_{2} + Phthalic acid salt}$^phthalimidetoamine

- Since the RDS is $\ce{SN_{2}}$ step only **1 degree aliphatic amines** can be prepared using this

## Ammonolysis

$\ce{R-Cl + NH_{3}->[polar aprotic solvent][little \Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-NH_{2} + R_{2}(NH) + R_{3}(N) + R_{4}(N+)Cl-}$

- This only happens when either $\ce{R-Cl}$ or $\ce{NH_{3}}$ is in excess
- If $\ce{R-Cl}$ in excess then we get all degree of amines via $\ce{SN_{2}}$ so we add little $\ce{NaOH}$ to consume the $\ce{HCl}$ produced
- If $\ce{NH_{3}}$ is in excess well no need of $\ce{NaOH}$ the $\ce{NH_{3}}$ will consume the $\ce{HCl}$ itself

# Reactions

## Reactions with $\ce{NaNO_{2},HCl}$

### With 1 degree Aromatic amine

This is our diazotization no questions

![[Aniline#Diazotization]]

### With 1 degree Aliphatic amine

$\ce{R-NH_{2}->[HNO_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-N_{2}+Cl- ->[unstable fo N_{2} leaves] R+}$^hno2with1degreealiphaticamine

- Now this carbocation rearranges and after that due to present $\ce{H_{2}O}$ alcohol forms
- HOWEVER it was observed that when **$\ce{R}$=$\ce{Methyl group}$ then corresponding ether ( dimethyl ether ) is the major product**

### With 2 degree any amine

![[Tests of Organic Chemistry#Liebermann Nitroso Test]]

### With 3 degree Aliphatic amine

$\ce{R_{1}R_{2}R_{3}(N)->[HNO_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R_{1}-OH + R_{2}R_{3}(N)-N=O ( yellow oily liquid )(given R_{1} is less steric)}$^hno2with3degreealiphaticamine

- Here the group that is least steric will migrate and become alcohol
- $\ce{OH-}$ attacks $\ce{R_{1}}$ via $\ce{SN_{2}}$

### With 3 degree Aromatic amine

$\ce{PhR_{1}R_{2}(N)->[HNO_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{NO-Ph-R_{1}R_{2}(N) ( EAS on Benzene )}$^hno2with3degreearomaticamine

- Well nothing is favorable here so benzene takes care of the Electrophile

![[Tests of Organic Chemistry#Coupling Reaction]]

## N nucleophiles with carbonyl

$\ce{R_{2}-C=O + H_{2}N-G->[pH=3 to 4]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R_{2}-C=N-G}$^Nncuelphileswithcarbonyl

- Based on G we get products
- This pH is maintained such that carbonyl center is activated
- But here are some names you need to know
	 - Hydrazone is $\ce{-C=N-NH_{2}}$
	 - Phenyl Hydrazine ( $\ce{Ph-NH-NH_{2}}$ ) gives Phenyl Hydrazone ( $\ce{-C=N-NH-Ph}$ )
	 - Semi Carbazide ( $\ce{H_{2}N-NH-C(=O)-NH_{2}}$) gives Semi Carbazone                                         ( $\ce{-C=N-NH-C(=O)-NH_{2}}$ )
	 - $\ce{HCN}$ given cyanohydrin ( $\ce{-C(-CN)-OH}$ ) so don't eliminate water
	 - Also the famous 2,4 DNP is nothing but 2,4-dinitro Phenyl Hydrazine so yeah that's a test

#### Mechanism
soon chill

## Beckmann Rearrangement

$\ce{RR'-C=N-OH->[literally any dehydrator]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-C(=O)-NH-R' ( given R' is trans to OH)}$^beckmannrearrangement

- Yeah in this reaction the stereoisomer affects the product not anything else
- Also $\ce{R,R' \neq H}$ so this is a reaction of Keto Oximes only
- That $\ce{R}$ migrates which is trans to the $\ce{-OH}$ group ( yeah $\ce{N}$'s lone pair is considered a geometrical isomer )
