$\ce{CH_{3}^{\delta+}-Br^{\delta-} + Mg->[dry][ether]}$%%qf%%$\ce{CH_{3}^{\delta-}-Mg^{\delta+}X}$

- The Carbon has a $\ce{\delta+}$ before and has a $\ce{\delta-}$ charge ( it's polarity changed ). 
- This type of things are called **Umpolung Reaction** 


**NOTE:** It doesn't matter if the $\ce{R}$ is bridgehead / unstable. GR doesn't form $\ce{C+}$ so it doesn't care. It just adds itself.
## Reactivity ( towards preparation )
For preparation of G.R, because bond between $\ce{C-X}$ is being broken, the weaker the bond, the easier.
- $\ce{C-I > C-Br > C-Cl \gg C-F}$

- The weaker the bond, the easier to prepare.
