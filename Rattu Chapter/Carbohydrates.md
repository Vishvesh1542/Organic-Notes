-  " They are optically active polyhydroxy aldehyde, ketone (or) substances that yield these types of compounds on hydrolysis "
- " They are cyclic hemiacetal, hemiketal, acetal, ketal of polyhydroxy carbonyl groups "

# Nomenclature

1. Suffix of "ose"
2. On the basis of no. of carbon atoms:
   - Triose -> 3 carbon atoms
   - Tetraose -> 4 carbon atoms
   - Pentose -> 5 carbon atoms
   - Hexose -> 6 carbon atoms
3. Aldehyde containing -> aldose
4. Ketone containing -> ketose

- $\ce{CH(=O)-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(OH)}$  is called $\ce{D}$-glyceraldehyde if second last carbon is on right side
- $\ce{CH(=O)-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(OH)}$  is called $\ce{L}$-glyceraldehyde if second last carbon is on left side

# Classification

## Based on hydrolysis

- Based on how many products they give we classify them as monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides

	 ### Monosaccharides
	- Carbohydrates that cannot give simpler carbohydrates on hydrolysis
	- Ex- Glucose, Fructose
	
	  ### Oligosaccharides
	  - Carbohydrates that give 2-10 monosaccharides on hydrolysis
	  - these are further called disaccharides, trisaccharides etc.
	  - The two monosaccharides obtained can be same or different
	  - Ex-Maltose, Sucrose
	  
	 ### Polysaccharides
	 - These give like >10 monosaccharides on hydrolysis
	 - Ex-Starch, Cellulose

## Based on sweetness?

- They are classified as sugars and non sugars

	 ### Sugars
	 - Crystalline solids, sweet in taste and water soluble
	 - all mono and oligo saccharides come under this
	 
	 ### Non-Sugars
	 - Not crystalline solids, not sweet in taste and not water soluble
	 - all poly saccharides come under this

## Based on reducing nature

- They are classified as reducing and non reducing sugars

	 ### Reducing Sugar
	 - Carbohydrates which can reduce tollen's reagent or Fehling's solution
	 - all mono and di saccharides come under this **except Sucrose**
	 
	 ### Non -Reducing Sugar
	 - They can't reduce tollen's or Fehling's solution
	 - all polysaccharides along with **Sucrose** come under this

# Monosaccharides

# Reactions of Glucose
- WAROhwriohwa

# Disaccharides
## Sucrose

- gives $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose + $\ce{\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-(-)-Fructose on hydrolysis

- **C1-C2 glycosidic linkage**

## Maltose

- gives $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose + $\ce{\alpha  /\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose on hydrolysis
- Default is $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose

- **C1-C4 Glycosidic linkage**

## Lactose

- gives $\ce{\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Galactose + $\ce{\alpha  /\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose on hydrolysis
- Default is $\ce{\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-(+)-Glucose

- **C1-C4 Glycosidic linkage**

# Polysaccharides

## Starch

- Main storage of carbohydrates in plants
- literally only has $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-glucose in it or you can say maltose
- Starch is separated into 2 parts

	### Amylose
	-  Water soluble part of starch
	- composes of 20% of starch
	-  fully linear with **C1-C4 glycosidic linkage** between $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-glucose units
	- has like 200-1000 glucose units
	
	### Amylopectin
	- Water insoluble part of starch
	- composes of 80% of starch
	- linear with **C1-C4 glycosidic linkage** between $\ce{\alpha}$-$\ce{D}$-glucose units along with occasional branching at **C1-C6 glycosidic linkage**
	- branches like every 25-27 glucose units

## Glycogen

- main storage of carbohydrates in animals ( animal starch )
- It is literally same as amylopectin but only difference is that it has more branching ( every 6-7 glucose units )

## Cellulose

- Cell wall of plant cells is composed of this thing
- literally only has linear **C1-C4 glycosidic** linkages between $\ce{\beta}$-$\ce{D}$-glucose
