-  " They are optically active polyhydroxy aldehyde, ketone (or) substances that yield these types of compounds on hydrolysis "
- " They are cyclic hemiacetal, hemiketal, acetal, ketal of polyhydroxy carbonyl groups "

# Nomenclature
1. Suffix of "ose"
2. On the basis of no. of carbon atoms:
   - Triose -> 3 carbon atoms
   - Tetraose -> 4 carbon atoms
   - Pentose -> 5 carbon atoms
   - Hexose -> 6 carbon atoms
3. Aldehyde containing -> aldose
4. Ketone contatining -> ketose

$\ce{C(O)-C(OH)-C(OH)}$  is called glyceraldehyde ( D ) if second last carbon is on right side


# Reactions of Glucose
- WAROhwriohwa

# Disaccharides
## Sucrose
$\ce{\alpha}$-D-(+)-Glucose + $\ce{\beta}$-D-(-)-Fructose

**C1-C2 glycosidic linkage**

## Maltose
$\ce{\alpha}$-D-(+)-Glucose + $\ce{\alpha  /\beta}$-D-(+)-Glucose
Default is $\ce{\alpha}$-D-(+)-Glucose

**C1-C4 Glycosidic linkage**

## Lactose
$\ce{\beta}$-D-(+)-Galactose + $\ce{\alpha  /\beta}$-D-(+)-Glucose
Default is $\ce{\beta}$-D-(+)-Glucose

**C1-C4 Glycosidic linkage**
