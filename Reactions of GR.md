# Reactivity
The more unstable the G.R, the more reactive.
1. Since, $\ce{R^{\delta-}}-Mg^{\delta+}X$ is there, the more unstable the $\ce{R^{\delta-}}$ the more reactive, the G.R
2. If comparing with $X$, the more $-I$ the more unstable, hence, more reactive
	Therefore, $RMg-I > RMg-Br > RMg-Cl > RMg-F$


# Reactions of GR

When checking what reactions $GR$ does, you check 1 thing,
- GR reacts with almost everything (Except dry ether.)

## Presence of acidic proton

this is the **First** ask. GR first is a base, and then a $Nu-$.
In presence of acidic $H+$ it acts as a [[GR as a base | Base]]


## Exception with Ethers

- Mostly, it doesn't react with Ether. But with 2 specific ethers, it reacts because of how unstable the ethers are
- The ethers that Grignard reagent spontaneously reacts with are %%qf%% 3 membered and 4 membered cyclic ether
