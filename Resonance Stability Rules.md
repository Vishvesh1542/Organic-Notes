1. More $\pi$ bonds in conjugated system $\implies$ more stable
2. Complete octet R.S are more stable
3. Neutral R.S are more stable
4. If charged:
   - Comparison along group $\implies$ Size dominates
   - Comparison in period $\implies$ E.N dominates
1. Aromatic R.S are more stable
2. 
   - Negative charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E-}$ withdrawing groups
   - Positive charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E+}$ donating groups
1. Linear Conjugation $>$ Cross Conjugation
