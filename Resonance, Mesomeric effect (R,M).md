- Definition- **"Phenomena of delocalization of conjugated $\pi$ electrons"**
- When single structure cant explain all properties of molecule we use resonance structures
- None of the canonical structures exist , their hybrid called "Resonance Hybrid" exists
- More stable Resonance Structure, more its contribution in the hybrid
- It is also of 2 types, $\ce{+M , +R}$ or $\ce{-M , -R}$
- Reference to check $\ce{+M or -M}$ is $\ce{-CH=CH_{2}}$
 
### Rules of Resonance
- Resonance only occurs in **Planar systems**
- Net charge, arrangement of atoms, number of paired and unpaired electrons, hybridization of an atom all remain unchanged
- Do NOT exceed octet of 2nd period elements in resonance
- In molecules where all resonance structures are equal, net charge can be calculated on each atom and bond order given by
%%sf%%
$$\ce{1 + \left(\frac{no. of \pi\ bond}{no. of \sigma\ bonds in the system}  \right) = \frac{No. of bonds in resonance}{No. of resonance structures}}$$

### Rules to determine stability of Resonance Structures
%%sf%%
1. More $\pi$ bonds in conjugated system $\implies$ more stable
2. Complete octet R.S are more stable
3. Neutral R.S are more stable
4. If charged:
   - Comparison along group $\implies$ Size dominates
   - Comparison in period $\implies$ E.N dominates
5. Aromatic R.S are more stable
6. 
   - Negative charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E-}$ withdrawing groups
   - Positive charge gets stabilized by $\ce{E+}$ donating groups
1. Linear Conjugation $>$ Cross Conjugation

### Resonance Energy

- Definition- **"The energy difference between the most stable resonance structure and the resonance hybrid"**
- Known Values

|    Molecule    | Resonance Energy ( KCal ) |
| :------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Benzene     |            36             |
|   Napthalene   |            61             |
|   Anthracene   |            84             |
|  Phenanthrene  |            92             |
| Buta-1,3-diene |             4             |
### Order of +M
%%sf%%
$\ce{C- > N- > O- >}$ %% Charged species always first %%
$\ce{-NH_{2} > -NHR > -NR_{2} >}$ %% Steric crowding %%
$\ce{ OH > OR >}$  %% Electronegativity + Steric Crowding %%
$\ce{-NH-C(=O)-R > -O-C(=O)-R >}$ %% Electronegativity %%
$\ce{-Ph > -C#C > -C=C >}$ %% more number of pi bonds %%
$\ce{-F > -Cl > -Br > -I >}$ %% overlapping of orbitals > Electronegativity %%
$\ce{-N=C}$ %% intramolecular resonance %%
%%ef%%
### Order of -M
%%sf%%
$\ce{-NO_{2} > -CN > -SO_{3}H >}$ %% top 3 experimentally %%
$\ce{-CHO > -C(=O)R > -C(=O)-O-C(=O)-R > -C(=O)-OR > -C(=O)-NH_{2} > -C(=O)-O- }$ %% intra-resonance + electronegativity %%
$\ce{ > -C#C > -Ph > -C=C}$ %% Electronegativity %%
