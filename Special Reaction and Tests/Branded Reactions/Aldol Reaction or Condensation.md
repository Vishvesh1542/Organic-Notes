- Shown by aldehydes or ketones HAVING $\ce{\alpha}$-Hydrogen 
- Reagent for aldol is %%qf%% Diluted bases like $\ce{dil NaOH/\Delta}$
- Product of Aldol reaction is %%qf%% $\ce{\beta-Hydroxy Aldehyde/Keotne}$
- Upon heating you get Aldol Condensation product which is %%qf%% $\ce{\alpha,\beta -Unsaturated Aldehyde or Ketone}$ 

## Mechanism
soon-ish

## Crossed Aldol

- if we have different reactants then all possible combinations of the 2 will form
- The major product is given by Nucleophilic strength and Deficient center
- So majorly Ketones act as the nucleophile and Aldehyde as the deficient center
- Also if one of the reactants doesn't have an $\ce{\alpha}$-Hydrogen then the Nuclephile formed by the other reactant will attack it only ( Probability factor )

## Intramolecular Aldol

- This happens when we have 2 or more carbonyl groups in same molecule
- ALL acidic H will go with equal probability as it is NOT the RDS step
- We have to check all possibilities of ring formation and form the ring which is most stable ( 6 membered ring > 5 membered > 7 membered > 4 membered > 3 membered)

## Retro Aldol

- Basically we have to deduce the reactants given the product to us
- If Aldol condensation product given, break the double bond and add $\ce{=O}$ to that side not having $\ce{=O}$ and $\ce{H}$ to the other side
- If Aldol reaction product given form the aldol condensation product by elimination of $\ce{-OH}$ via $\ce{E_{1}CB}$ and follow same steps as above
- Also $\ce{\implies}$ is the symbol for retro reactions
