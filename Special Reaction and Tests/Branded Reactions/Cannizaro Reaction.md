- Shown by aldehydes or ketones  NOT HAVING $\ce{\alpha}$-Hydrogen 
- Reagent for Cannizaro Reaction is %%qf%% conc. bases like $\ce{conc. or 50 percent NaOH/\Delta}$
- Product of Cannizaro reaction is %%qf%% $\ce{coresponding alcohol and salt of cayboxylic acid of said substrate}$
- Order of Cannizaro reaction is %%qf%% 3 as $\ce{rate=k[Substrate]^2[OH-]}$ 
## Mechanism
soon-ish
## Crossed Cannizaro

- $\ce{OH-}$ is a nucleophile here so more deficient center gets attacked
- The simple trick is the Carbonyl Carbon that is more rich gets reduced and more poor one gets oxidized 

## Intramolecular Cannizaro

- This happens when we have 2 or more carbonyl groups in same molecule
- both Carboxylic acid and alcohol form in the same molecule
- Here also rich carbonyl gets reduced and poor gets oxidized 

## Retro Cannizaro

- Just form carbonyl to both the alcohol and carboxylic acid its nothing
