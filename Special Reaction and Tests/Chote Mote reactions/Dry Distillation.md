#organic FLASH!

why does this exist AHH

$\ce{2RCOOH->[MO or M(OH)2][M=Ca,Ba,Mn]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{(RCOO^-)2M}$^drydistilstep1

$\ce{(RCOO^-)2M->[\Delta][-MCO_{3} (M=Ca,Ba,Mn )]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R-C(=O)-R}$^drydistilstep2

- This is called Dry distillation
- It can be crossed where all possible combinations form
- It can be intramolecular where most stable ringed ketone forms

yeah thats pretty much it
