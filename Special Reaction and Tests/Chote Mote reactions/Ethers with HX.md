- $\ce{R-O-R'->[HX]}$ where $\ce{X}$ is $\ce{Cl,Br or I}$ is a variable mechanism reaction

- it is $\ce{SN_{1}}$ given that one of $\ce{R+ or R'+}$ is tertiary or stable as hell ( resonance ) so the carbocation forms, rearranges and $\ce{X-}$ attacks
- if not its $\ce{SN_{2}}$ where $\ce{X-}$ attacks less sterric side
- if anhydrous $\ce{HX}$ ALWAYS $\ce{SN_{2}}$ no matter what

- Reactivity rate is $\ce{ HI>HBr>HCl\gg HF}$

#### Examples

$\ce{tBu-O-CH_{3}->[HI] tBu+ + CH_{3}OH-> tBu-I + CH_{3}OH}$

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-O-CH_{3}->[HI] CH_{3}-CH_{2}-OH + CH_{3}I}$
