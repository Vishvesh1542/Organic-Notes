It only acts as a base when $H+$ is present

# Sources of acidic proton
1. $N-H$
2. $O-H$
3. $F-H$
4. $S-H$
5. $\ce{C#C-H}$
6. Active Methylene H ( $\ce{NO_{2}-CH_{2}-NO_{2}}$ or any withdrawing groups )
If any of the above $H$ are present in the compound, $GR$ acts like a Base and does acid base rxn.

# Examples
### Ex. 1 H2O
$\ce{CH_{3}-Mg-Br + H_{2}O}$
1. There is a $\ce{O-H}$ Bond. 
2. So, it acts like a base.
3. $CH_{3}^- + MgBr+$ forms
4. Now, $\ce{H+}$ from $\ce{H_{2}O}$ reacts with $CH_{3}$
5. Forms $CH_{4} +HO-Mg-Br$

### Ex. 2 acids
$\ce{CH_{3}-Mg-Br + CH_{3}-COOH}$
1. There is $\ce{O-H}$ bond.
2. So, $GR$ breaks as: $\ce{CH_{3}- + MgBr+}$
3. $\ce{CH_{3}- + H+ -> CH_{4}}$
4. Full reaction: $\ce{CH_{3}-Mg-Br + CH_{3}-COOH ->[dry ether] CH_{4} + HO-MgBr}$

### Ex. 3 Amines | Amides
$\ce{CH_{3}-Mg-Br + CH_{3}-NH_{2}}$
1. There is an $\ce{N-H}$ bond
2. So, $\ce{GR}$ breaks to form Base
3. $\ce{CH_{3}- + MgBr+}$
4. The anion reacts with $\ce{H+}$ and cation with $\ce{OH-}$
5. $\ce{CH_{3}-MgBr + CH_{3}-NH_{2} ->[dry ether]CH_{4}+CH_{3}-NH-MgBr}$
