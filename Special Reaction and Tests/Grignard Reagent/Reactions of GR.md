## Reactivity
The more unstable the G.R, the more reactive.
1. Since, $\ce{R^{\delta-}}-Mg^{\delta+}X$ is there, the more unstable the $\ce{R^{\delta-}}$ the more reactive, the G.R
2. If comparing with $X$, the more $-I$ the more unstable, hence, more reactive
	Therefore, $RMg-I > RMg-Br > RMg-Cl > RMg-F$

## How GR reacts

- GR is crack it reacts with everything except ethers
- Whenever grig reagent present FIRST it calls itself **strong base** and searches for acidic $\ce{H}$
- If it finds one it reacts as a [[GR as a base|base]]
- If it doesn't it calls to $\ce{Nu-}$ and breaks into $\ce{R- + MgBr+}$ where $\ce{R-}$ is the nucleophile
- It follows an order of reactivity like

Order of Reactivity of Grig Reagent -> %%qf%% Acid-Base > Aldehyde > Ketone > Acid Halide > Anhydride > Ester > Substituted amine > Alkyl Halides

- Except Alkyl Halide reaction which follows $\ce{SN_{2}}$ with inversion others follow $\ce{SN_{2}Th}$ with racemization
- AlSO if there is ever a situation where same molecule has a Nucleophile and deficient center 99.9% of the time intra molecular reaction happens and ring forms

## Exception with Ethers

- Mostly, it doesn't react with Ether. But with 2 specific ethers, it reacts because of how unstable the ethers are
- The ethers that Grignard reagent spontaneously reacts with are %%qf%% 3 membered and 4 membered cyclic ether
