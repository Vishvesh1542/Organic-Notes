- A reaction in which $\ce{CHX_{3}}$ forms ( where $\ce{X}$ = $\ce{Cl, Br, I}$ )
- **$\ce{F}$** DOES NOT SHOW HALO-FORM as $\ce{CHF_{3}}$ is unstable
- Reagent of halo-form reaction: %%qf%% $\ce{NaOH + X_{2}}$ or $\ce{NaOX}$ or generally Base+Halogen
- Fun fact- $\ce{Ca(OH)2 +I_{2}}$ is same as $\ce{CaOCl_{2}}$ which means bleaching powder also is a reagent for haloform

Note that $\ce{CHI_{3}}$ is the only halo-form which is easily identifiable because it has a yellow precipitate. Other two ( $\ce{CHBr_{3}}$ with pale yellow color and $\ce{CHCl_{3}}$ with pale white color ) as liquids
 
# Who reacts to give halo-forms
General rule of thumb, the following groups react to give halo-form:
1. $\ce{-C(O)-CH_{3}}$
2. $\ce{-C(OH)-CH_{3}}$
3. $\ce{-CH(X)-CH_{3}}$

- DONT GET CONFUSED, halo-form is reaction of aldehyde and ketone only, its just that these molecules also get converted to aldehyde and ketone in presence of reagent as follows

$\ce{R-C(OH)-CH_{3}->[NaOH + I_{2}][AKA NaOI, Oxidant] R-C(=O)-CH_{3}}$ which shows iodoform

$\ce{R-C(Cl)-CH_{3}->[NaOH][SN_{2}] R-C(OH)-CH_{3}}$ which shows iodoform


# Mechanism
You can see the mechanism[[Halo-form mechanism| here]].
- Net reaction:
  $\ce{CH_{3}-C(O)-H + 4NaOH + 3I_{2} -> CHI_{3} + 3H_{2}O + 3NaI + H-C(O)^-Na+ }$

- **VERY VERY IMPORTANT** Rate of reaction in iodoform is same for all $\ce{Cl, Br, I}$ as it is not leaving in the RDS. acidicity of $\ce{H}$ decides rate.
