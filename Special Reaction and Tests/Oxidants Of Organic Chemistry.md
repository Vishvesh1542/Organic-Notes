- We also have many HERE

## Strong Oxidants
%%sf%%

- $\ce{H_{2}CrO_{4} \Delta}$
%%ef%%

## Mid Oxidants
%%sf%%

## How they react

- We will be using SOA, MOA and WOA as abbreviations for stronk, mid and weak oxidants respectively as all of same group react the same
- now we will see EACH FUNCTIONAL GROUP

### Oxidation of Alcohol ( Primary )
%%sf%%
- SOA -> respective Carboxylic acid
- MOA -> respective Carboxylic acid
- WOA -> respective aldehyde
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Alcohol ( Secondary )
%%sf%%
- SOA -> respective Ketone ( Popaff's rule if conditions are drastic )
- MOA -> respective Ketone
- WOA -> respective Ketone
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Alcohol ( Tertiary )
%%sf%%
- SOA -> No reaction
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
- **Note** - $\ce{Cu, \Delta}$ oxidant due to high temp. will perform $\ce{E_{2}}$ on the alcohol
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Aldehyde
%%sf%%
- SOA -> respective Carboxylic acid
- MOA -> respective Carboxylic acid
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Ketone
%%sf%%
- SOA -> Popaff's rule if conditions are drastic
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Carboxylic Acid
%%sf%%
- SOA -> No reaction
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Methanol
%%sf%%
- SOA -> formic acid but can further oxidize to $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$ as there is an aldehyde group
- MOA -> formic acid
- WOA -> formaldehyde
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Formaldehyde
%%sf%%
- SOA -> formic acid but can further oxidize to $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$ as there is an aldehyde group
- MOA -> formic acid
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of Formic Acid
%%sf%%
- SOA -> can further oxidize to $\ce{CO_{2} + H_{2}O}$ as there is an aldehyde group
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of non-terminal Alkene
%%sf%%
- SOA -> Same as **Oxidative Ozonolysis** of said alkene
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of terminal Alkene
%%sf%%
- SOA -> Same as **Oxidative Ozonolysis** of said alkene ( Oxidize formaldehyde further if formed )
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of non-terminal Alkyne
%%sf%%
- SOA -> Same as **Oxidative Ozonolysis** of said alkyne
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%

### Oxidation of terminal Alkyne
%%sf%%
- SOA -> Same as **Oxidative Ozonolysis** of said alkyne ( Oxidize formic acid further if formed)
- MOA -> No reaction
- WOA -> No reaction
%%ef%%


## Popaff's rule
%%sf%%
- used for further oxidation of ketones which is only possible by conc. SOA under drastic conditions
### Rule 1

- Ketone ONLY oxidizes if $\ce{\alpha}$-Carbon is $\ce{-CH_{2}-}$ or $\ce{-CH_{3}}$
### Rule 2

- if ketone is asymmetrical cleavage happens that side where more carbon atoms are present
- final product is mix of Carboxylic acids having less carbon atoms than parent chain

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-CH_{2}-C(=O)-CH_{3}->[conc. SOA][623K] CH_{3}-CH_{2}-C(=O)-OH + CH_{3}-C(=O)-OH}$

- **Note**- the $\ce{C=O}$ of original ketone stays on that side with less Carbon atoms so eb careful when isotopic Oxygens are present
