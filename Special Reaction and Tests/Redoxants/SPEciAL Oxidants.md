- Some chote mote guys that exist

## $\ce{MnO_{2} \Delta}$ as an Oxidant
%%sf%%
- This guy can ONLY oxidize allylic or benzylic alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls PROVIDED the said allylic or benzylic carbon atom has at least 1 hydrogen ( so specific )
%%ef%%

- Examples-
$\ce{CH_{2}=CH-CH_{2}OH->[MnO_{2} \Delta] CH_{2}=CH-C(=O)-H}$

$\ce{Ph-CH_{2}OH->[MnO_{2} \Delta] Ph-C(=O)-H}$

## $\ce{SeO_{2} \Delta}$ as an Oxidant
%%sf%%
- This guy can ONLY oxidize $\ce{\alpha}$-Carbon of aldehyde or ketone to carbonyls ( why so specific )
- If asymmetrical ketone then less steric side is oxidized
- Only 1 carbon is oxidized per equivalent
- CAN oxidize active methylene carbons also ( Provided they have 2 Hydrogens )
%%ef%%

- Examples-
$\ce{CH_{3}-C(=O)-CH_{3}->[SeO_{2} \Delta] CH_{3}-C(=O)-C(=O)H}$

$\ce{CH_{3}-CH_{2}-C(=O)-CH_{3}->[SeO_{2} \Delta] CH_{3}-CH_{2}-C(=O)-C(=O)H}$

## $\ce{HIO_{4} or Pb(CH_{3}COO)4}$ as an Oxidant
%%sf%%
- Can only oxidize 4 systems ( **syn** diol, $\ce{\alpha}$-hydroxy ketone, diketone and $\ce{\alpha}$-amino alcohol)
- the trick is like ozonolysis to break the bond between the system and put -OH and -OH on either side, it 2 OH on same carbon eliminate water
%%ef%%

- Examples
$\ce{CH_{3}-CH(-OH)-CH(-OH)-H->[HIO_{4}] CH_{3}-C(=O)-H + CH_{2}O}$

## Epoxydation of Alkenes

- we have 3 ppl for this

### 1) Peroxy acids

- any acid that contains peroxy bond works
- most common one used is mCPBA ( meta chloro per Benzoic Acid )
- This does syn addition then elimination to form epoxy ( highly stereospecific )

$\ce{-C=C- ->[mCPBA]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(-O-)C-(its an epoxy group)}$

### 2) $\ce{Ag + O_{2} \Delta}$

- it forms $\ce{Ag_{2}O + Nassenct O}$ which does the epoxying

$\ce{-C=C- ->[Ag + O_{2}]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(-O-)C-(its an epoxy group)}$

### 3) $\ce{HOBr then OH-}$

- its a 2 step reaction first $\ce{HO- Br}$ attaches itself then due to $\ce{OH-}$ $\ce{H+}$ eliminates and forma epoxy

$\ce{-C=C- ->[(i)HOBr][(ii)OH-]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(OH)-C(Br)-( first this ) ->[OH-]-C(-O-)C-( its an epoxy group )}$


## Hydro oxidation of alkenes

- again 3 ppl for this

$\ce{-C=C-->[cold KMnO_{4}][aq.OH-]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(OH)-C(OH)-( syndiol )}$

$\ce{-C=C-->[OsO_{4}][NaHSO_{3},H_{2}O]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(OH)-C(OH)-( syndiol )}$

$\ce{-C=C-->[(i)Epoxydation][(ii)H_{2}O, H+ or OH-]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{-C(OH)-C(OH)-( antidiol )}$


WE ARE STILL NOT DONE
