- For some reason this is a whole topic

## Aliphatic and Aromatic Nitro

$\ce{R,Ar-NO_{2} ->[Sn or Fe or Zn,HCl]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R,Ar-NH_{2}}$^nitrotoamine

- Here $\ce{Fe}$ is the best in yield

$\ce{R,Ar-NO_{2}->[Fe + Steam][or H_{2}O+ \Delta]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R,Ar-N=O}$^nitrotonitroso

$\ce{R,Ar-NO_{2}->[Zn + NH_{4}Cl]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{R,Ar-NH-OH}$^nitrotohydroxyamine

### Nitrobenzene

- But there are some other weird cases with Nitrobenzene

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2}->[Zn + NaOH][in MeOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-N=N-Ph ( Azobenzene )}$^nitrotoazobenzene

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2}->[Zn + NaOH][in H_{2}O]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-NH-NH-Ph ( Hydraazobenzene )}$^nitrotohydraazobenzene

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2}->[Na_{3}AsO_{3}][in NaOH]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-N=N(->O)-Ph ( Azoxybenzene )}$^nitrotoazoxybenzene

- There are cases in electrolytic reduction also LIKE WHY??

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2} ->[Reduction in][Weakly Acidic Medium]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{Ph-NH_{2}}$^electrolyticnitrotoanime

$\ce{Ph-NO_{2} ->[Reduction in][Highly Acidic Medium]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{HO-Ph-NH_{2} (Para Amino Phenol)}$^electrolyticnitrotoanime

#### Zenith Reagent

- $\ce{(NH_{4})2S or NH_{4}HS}$
- Literally was made such that we can reduce only 1 Nitro in a Poly-Nitro Benzene at a time unlike others who do all Nitros at once

$\ce{O_{2}N-Ph-NO_{2} ->[NH_{4}HS][1 eq]}$ %%qf%% $\ce{H_{2}N-Ph-NO_{2}}$^polynitrotosinglenitrobenzene

- The Nitro groups can be anywhere and only 1 gets reduced at a time
