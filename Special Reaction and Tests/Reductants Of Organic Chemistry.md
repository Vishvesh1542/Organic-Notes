- We have Branded THIRTEEN reductants ðŸ’€
- See [[Steps of Reduction for Functional Groups]]

## 1) $\ce{H_{2} + Pt / Pd / Ni}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Stronk-ish Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$ reduced to alkane
- **CANNOT** reduce Carboxylic Acid, Ester, Anhydride, Amide ( All Carboxylic Acid derivatives except Acid Halide )
- hydrogens are always added SYN so its a SYN-Addition
%%ef%%

## 2) $\ce{LiAlH_{4}}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Stronk Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X}$ reduced to alkane
- **CANNOT** reduce Alkene and Alkyne
- Solvent is **Ethers**
%%ef%%

## 3) $\ce{NaBH_{4}}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Stronk-ish Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$ reduced to alkane
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Aldehyde, Ketone, Acid Halide, Alkyl Halide and Imine
- Solvent is **Polar Protic**
%%ef%%

## 4) $\ce{Na in C_{2}H_{5}OH}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Mid Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$ reduced to alkane
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Carboxylic Acid, Amide, Nitro, Alkene and Alkyne
%%ef%%

## 5) $\ce{B_{2}H_{6}}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Stronk-ish Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$ reduced to alkane
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Aldehyde, Ketone, Carboxylic Acid, Alkene and Alkyne
- **BEST reductant for Carboxylic Acid** and solvent is **THF**
%%ef%%

## 6) $\ce{Red Phosphorous ,HI}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- BRANDED Reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alkane
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$, Epoxies reduced to alkane
- **CAN REDUCE ANYTHING**, but generally not used with unsaturation
%%ef%%

## 7.1) $\ce{SnCl_{2},HCl}$ ( Stephen's Reduction ) as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- mid Reductant
- **ONLY** reacts with cyanides and converts them to Imine
- Yes Imine can be further hydrolyzed into Aldehyde
- It works on the principle that $\ce{Sn^{+4}}$ more stable than $\ce{Sn^{+2}}$ so it reacts with $\ce{HCl}$ to give two nascent Hydrogen which reduce others
%%ef%%
## 7.2) $\ce{Sn,HCl}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- STRONK Reductant
- **ONLY reacts with** cyanides and Nitro and converts them to Imine
- Yes Imine can be further hydrolyzed into Aldehyde
- It works on the principle that $\ce{Sn^{+4}}$ more stable than $\ce{Sn^{+2}}$ so it reacts with $\ce{HCl}$ to give four nascent Hydrogen which reduce others
%%ef%%

## 8) $\ce{Zn-Hg in conc. HCl}$ ( Clemmenson's reduction ) as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- STRONK Reductant
- **ONLY reacts with** Aldehyde and Ketone and converts them to Alkane
- However if Acid-sensitive groups are present it reacts with them also as follows
	 - **Alcohol** gets converted to Chloride as $\ce{Zn,HCl}$ ( Lucas Reagent ) is present
	 - **Nitro** gets reduced to Amine as $\ce{Zn,HCl}$ ( Similar to $\ce{Sn,HCl}$ ) is present
	 - **Epoxides** ,**Ethers**, **Alkene and Alkyne** open up due to $\ce{H+}$ presence ( Electrophilic Addition )
%%ef%%

## 9) $\ce{NH_{2}NH_{2} + alc. KOH in C_{2}H_{5}OH,\Delta}$ ( Wolf Kishnner Reduction ) as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- STRONK Reductant
- **ONLY reacts with** Aldehyde and Ketone and converts them to Alkane
- However if Acid-sensitive groups are present it reacts with them also as follows
	 - **Acid Halides** get Substituted as $\ce{OH-}$ is present by $\ce{SN_{2}Th}$
	 - **Alkyl Halides** get $\ce{E_{2}}$ eliminated as $\ce{Alc.KOH + \Delta}$ is present
%%ef%%

## 10) DIBAL-H as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Weak Reductant
- Full name is **Di-Isobutyl Aluminum Hydride**
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Acid Halides, Esters and Cyanides ( Followed by Hydrolysis ) to Aldehydes
- Is a SINGLE $\ce{H-}$ donor
- Reaction takes place at $\ce{-70 to -78 degrees C }$ and at that temp if there are Alkene or Alkyne DONT HYDROLYZE THEM
%%ef%%

## 11) Group 1 Metal + liq. $\ce{NH_{3}}$ as a Reductant
%%sf%%
- Mid reductant
- Reduction is due to solvated $\ce{e-}$ and NOT $\ce{H-}$
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Alkene, Alkyne and Benzene and has cases
	 - **Alkyne** gets reduced to Trans-Alkene
	 - **Terminal Alkyne** does Acid-Base reaction
	 - **Alkene** does not react but **terminal alkene** gets reduced to alkane
	 - for benzene,  well see for yourself here... :(
%%ef%%

## 12) $\ce{LiBH_{4}}$ as a Reductant

- Mid reductant
- Oxygen containing compounds reduced to Alcohol
- Nitrogen containing compounds reduced to Amine
- $\ce{R-X,C=C,C#C}$ reduced to alkane
- **CAN ONLY** reduce Ester, Aldehyde and Ketone
%%ef%%
