- A test is basically a reaction which is used to determine the functional group or properties of the molecule
- A test ALWAYS has an observation which tells us the result, this could be color changing, funky smell. cloudiness or EXPLOSION 

## Bromine Water ( Test for unsaturation )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-CH=CH_{2}->[Br_{2}+H_{2}O][or HOBr] R-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(Br)}$^brominewatertestofalkenes

$\ce{R-C#CH->[Br_{2}+H_{2}O][or HOBr] R-C(OH)=CH(Br)}$^brominewatertestofalkynes

- **Observation**- The reddish Brown color of Bromine water disappears
- **What this tells us**- That alkene or alkyne is present in the mixture
- **Exceptions**- Benzene doesn't show this test but phenol and aniline do

## Bayer's Reagent ( Test for unsaturation )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-CH=CH_{2}->[dil.KMnO_{4}(Cold)][OH-] ->R-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(OH)}$^bayerreagenttestofalkenes

$\ce{R-C#CH->[dil.KMnO_{4}(Cold)][OH-] ->R-C(OH)=CH(OH)}$^bayerreagenttestofalkynes

- **Observation**- $\ce{KMnO_{4}}$ is purple but its consumed so its color disappears
- **What this tells us**- That alkene or alkyne is present in the mixture
- **Exceptions**- Benzene doesn't show this test

## Tollen's Test ( Test for Terminal Alkynes )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-C#CH->[NH_{4}OH+AgNO_{3}][or Ag(NH_{3})2OH] R-C#CAg + H_{2}O +NH_{4}NO_{3}}$^tollenstest

- [x] The reagent is called "Ammoniacal Silver Nitrate in basic mediuma
- **Observation**- $\ce{R-C#CAg}$ is a white precipitate so white color appears
- **What this tells us**- That terminal alkyne is present in mixture
- **Note**- Many functional groups show tollen's test so we will be kinda unsure whether its alkyne of something else

## Cuprous Chloride Test ( Test for terminal alkynes )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-C#CH->[NH_{4}OH+Cu_{2}Cl_{2}] R-C#CCu + H_{2}O +NH_{4}NO_{3}}$^cuprouschloridetest

- The reagent is called "Ammoniacal Cuprous Chloride"
- **Observation**- $\ce{R-C#CCu}$ is a white precipitate so white color appears
- **What this tells us**- That terminal alkyne is present in mixture
%%ef%%

## Lucas Test ( Test for degree of alcohol )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-OH + HCl->[ZnCl_{2}]R-Cl}$^lucastest

- R is an alkyl group of any degree
- **Observation**- The solution beaker gets cloudy (turbid) due to $\ce{R-Cl}$ formation
- **What this tells us-** The speed of turbidity tells us which degree alcohol it is
	- Turbidity instantly => tertiary alcohol
	- Turbidity after 2-5 mins => secondary alcohol
	- Turbidity after 10 mins-1 hr => advance 1 degree alcohol
	- Turbidity after like the earth ends => primary alcohol
- **Note-** Since this is SN1 mechanism reaction, this test will work for stuff like aromatic alcohols like Phenols so be careful
