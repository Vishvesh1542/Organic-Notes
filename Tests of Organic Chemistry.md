- A test is basically a reaction which is used to determine the functional group or properties of the molecule
- A test ALWAYS has an observation which tells us the result, this could be color changing, funky smell. cloudiness or EXPLOSION 

## Bromine Water ( Test for unsaturation )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-CH=CH_{2}->[Br_{2}+H_{2}O][or HOBr] R-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(Br)}$^brominewatertestofalkenes

$\ce{R-C#CH->[Br_{2}+H_{2}O][or HOBr] R-C(OH)=CH(Br)}$^brominewatertestofalkynes

- **Observation**- The reddish Brown color of Bromine water disappears
- **What this tells us**- That alkene or alkyne is present in the mixture
- **Exceptions**- Benzene doesn't show this test but phenol and aniline do

## Bayer's Reagent ( Test for unsaturation )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-CH=CH_{2}->[dil.KMnO_{4}(Cold)][OH-] ->R-CH(OH)-CH_{2}(OH)}$^bayerreagenttestofalkenes

$\ce{R-C#CH->[dil.KMnO_{4}(Cold)][OH-] ->R-C(OH)=CH(OH)}$^bayerreagenttestofalkenes

- **Observation**- $\ce{KMnO_{4}}$ is purple but its consumed so its color disappears
- **What this tells us**- That alkene or alkyne is present in the mixture
- **Exceptions**- Benzene doesn't show this test

## Tollen's Test ( Test for Terminal Alkynes )
%%sf%%
$\ce{R-C#CH->[NH_{4}OH+AgNO_{3}][or Ag(NH_{3})2OH] R-C#CAg + H_{2}O +NH_{4}NO_{3}}$

- The reagent is called "Ammonical Silver Nitrate in basic medium"
- **Observation**- $\ce{KMnO_{4}}$ is purple but its consumed so its color disappears
- **What this tells us**- That alkene or alkyne is present in the mixture
- **Exceptions**- Benzene doesn't show this test
